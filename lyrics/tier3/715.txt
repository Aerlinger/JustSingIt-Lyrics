Once there was this kid
Who got into an accident
And couldn't come to school

But when he finally came back
His hair had turned
From black into bright white
He said that it was from when
The cars had smashed so hard

Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

Once there was this girl
Who wouldn't go and change
With the girls in the change room

But when they finally made her
They saw birthmarks all over her body
She couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just been there

Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm

But both girl and boy were glad
'Cause one kid had it worse than that
'Cause then there was this boy whose
Parents made him come directly home
Right after school

And when they went to their church
They shook and lurched all over the church floor
He couldn't quite explain it
They'd always just gone there

Mmm mmm mmm mmm
Mmm mmm mmm mmm
