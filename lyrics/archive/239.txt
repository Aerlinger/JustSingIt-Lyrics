	<li><p>Ten miles from town and I just broke down</p></li>
	<li><p>Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm out here alone just tryin' to get home</p></li>
	<li><p>To tell you I was wrong but you already know</p></li>
	<li><p>Believe me I won't stop at nothin'</p></li>
	<li><p>To see you so I've started runnin'</p></li>
	<li><p>All that I'm after is a life full of laughter</p></li>
	<li><p>As long as I'm laughin' with you</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after</p></li>
	<li><p>After the life we've been through</p></li>
	<li><p>'Cause I know there's no life after you</p></li>
	<li><p>Last time we talked, the night that I walked</p></li>
	<li><p>Burns like an iron in the back of my mind</p></li>
	<li><p>I must've been high to say you and I</p></li>
	<li><p>Weren't meant to be and just wastin' my time</p></li>
	<li><p>Oh, why did I ever doubt you?</p></li>
	<li><p>You know I would die here without you</p></li>
	<li><p>All that I'm after is a life full of laughter</p></li>
	<li><p>As long as I'm laughin' with you</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after</p></li>
	<li><p>After the life we've been through</p></li>
	<li><p>'Cause I know there's no life after you</p></li>
	<li><p>You and I, right or wrong, there's no other one</p></li>
	<li><p>After this time I spent alone</p></li>
	<li><p>It's hard to believe that a man with sight could be so blind</p></li>
	<li><p>Thinkin' 'bout the better times, must've been outta my mind</p></li>
	<li><p>So I'm runnin' back to tell you</p></li>
	<li><p>All that I'm after is a life full of laughter</p></li>
	<li><p>Without you God knows what I'd do, yeah</p></li>
	<li><p>All that I'm after is a life full of laughter</p></li>
	<li><p>As long as I'm laughin' with you</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm thinkin' 'bout all that still matters is love ever after</p></li>
	<li><p>After the life we've been through, yeah</p></li>
	<li><p>Know there's no life after you</p></li>
	<li><p>Know there's no life after you</p></li>
	<li><p>Know there's no life after you</p></li>
	<li><p>Know there's no life after you</p></li>
	<li><p>Know there's no life after you</p></li>
	<li><p>Know there's no life after you</p></li>
	<li><p>Know there's no life after you</p></li>
	<li><p>Know there's no life after you, yeah</p></li>
