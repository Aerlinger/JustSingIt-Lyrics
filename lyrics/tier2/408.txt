Lil Jay on the track, ****
And you already know, it's ya boy, Lil Scrappy
We finna have the whole **** world rockin' in this ****
Look at shawty, check her out

I like it when she rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips, then wave and sip

Look at them hips, I like how she rock it
She bend that thing over and to the ground she gon' drop it
And pop it hard as she can, got me **** in the pants
Because she, all in her stance, doing her **** dance, man

Look, lil' buddy cute in the face, she rock her hips to the bass
She take the sip, then she wave
And wanna get with Lil' Jay after she dance on that pole
I pull my cash so quick and fast when that **** hit the flo'

Now I got 32 flavors of that bootylicious bubblegum
Raspberry, grape, cherry, come and get this honeybun
Yummy, yum, baby, not an ordinary lady
Known to drive a **** crazy, Willie Wonka wanna pay me

On the daily, off the hizzle, rock my hizzle and shake my skittles
Soda, pop it, watch it sizzle, man, this **** right here's the shizzle
**** on the highest drizzle, wanna taste it just a little
Rock my hips, then make it wiggle, wavin', sippin' in this bizzle

I like it when she rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips, then wave and sip

I like it when she rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips, then wave and sip

I like it when she show me she can rock it, roll it, drop it to the flo'
Bouncin' slow, shawty's all pro, that's the way to go
Jello booty, ooh wee, got a **** glancin' every time that **** react
I tawt I taw a puddy cat, gimme, gimme, gimme that

Fat cat, don't act on a pimp
You got me enticed by the way you rock them hips
You's a trip, girl, doin' all them tricks, that's what's up
I like that **** a lot, come and holla at a thug

A-town's finest, I'm the top-notch glamor chick
Tell me, if I throw it at ya, baby, can you handle it?
'Cause the cause is Russian, if a hater wanna run they lip
Step up in the club and have them whisperin', 'God ****, she thick'

Take it to the bar, Hpnotiq and Hennessy is on my list
Seductively moving my body, now watch me rock my hips
Take a sip of the Goose, I'm lookin' good and livin' lavish
Big boy pimpin', poppin', dippin', now tell me I'm not the baddest

I like it when she rock her hips, then take it low
She grab the towel and wipe the pole, oh oh
Shawty got it goin' on, it's just me and her
And I'm in my zone

Check out her rack
Shawty got a fat ****, watch her throw that **** back
And say she sweet like snacks, let you put her on the track
Every day you eat less, countin' **** stacks

I like it when she rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips, then wave and sip

I like it when she rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips, then wave and sip

She rock her hips
She rock her hips
I like the way she rock her hips, she rock her hips
I like the way she rock her hips
