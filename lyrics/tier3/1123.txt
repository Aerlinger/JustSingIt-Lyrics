All day, all night [x8]
What the f*ck!?

When I came to Spain and I saw people party
I told to myself: What the f*ck!?
All day, all night
All day, all night
Viva la fiesta, viva la noche
Viva los DJ's
I couldn't believe what I was living
So I called my friend Johnny
And I said to him: Johnny,
La gente esta muy loca,
What the f*ck!?

Johnny, la gente esta muy loca,
What the f*ck!?

When I came to Spain and I saw people party
I told to myself: What the f*ck!?

All day, all night
All day, all night
Viva la fiesta, viva la noche
Viva los DJ's
What the f*ck!?
Viva la fiesta, viva la noche
Viva los DJ's
What the f*ck!?
Viva la fiesta [repeat]
Viva...[repeat]

I couldn't believe what I was living
So I called my friend Johnny
And I said to him: Johnny,
La gente esta muy loca,
What the f*ck!?

Johnny, la gente esta muy loca,
What the f*ck!?

What the f*ck!?
