Baby I see u workin' hard I wanna let ya know I'm proud
Let u know that I admire what u do
The more if I need 2 reassure u
My life would be purposeless without u

If I want it when I ask u, u provide it
U inspire me 2 be better
U challenge me for the better
Sit back and let me pour out my love letter

Let me help u take of ur shoes
Untie ur shoestrings, take off ur cufflinks
What ya wanna eat boo? Let me feed u
Let me run ur bathwater whatever u desire I'll supply ya

Sing u a song, turn my game on
I'll brush ur hair, help u put ur du rag on
If u want a foot rub, if u want a manicure
Baby, I'm urs I wanna cater 2 u boy

Let me cater 2 u cause baby this is ur day
Do anything for my man, baby u blow me away
I got ur slippers, ur dinner, ur dessert and so much more
Anything u want let me cater 2 u

Inspire me from the heart, can't nuthin' tear us apart
Ur all I want in a man, I put my life in ur hands
I got ur slippers, ur dinner, ur dessert and so much more
Anything u want I want 2 cater 2 u

Baby I'm happy ur home let me hold u in my arms
I just want 2 take the stress away from u
Makin' sure that I'm doin' my part
Boy, is there somethin' u need me 2 do?
If u want it, say the word, I, I can try it
I know whatever I'm not fulfillin' another woman is willin'
I'm gonna fulfill u, my body and spirit

I promise u I'll keep myself up
Remain the same chick u fell in love with
I'll keep it tight, I'll keep my figure right
I'll keep my hair fixed, keep rocking the hottest outfits

When u come home late tap me on my shoulder I'll roll over
Baby, I heard u, I'm here 2 serve u
If it's love u need 2 give it is my joy
All I wanna do is cater 2 u boy

Let me cater 2 u cause baby this is ur day
Do anything for my man baby u blow me away
I got ur slippers, ur dinner, ur dessert and so much more
Anything u want let me cater 2 u

Inspire me from the heart can't nuthin' tear us apart
Ur all I want in a man, I put my life in ur hands
I got ur slippers, ur dinner, ur dessert and so much more
Anything u want I want 2 cater 2 u

I wanna give u my breath, my strength, my will 2 u
That's the least I can do, let me cater 2 u
Through the good, the bad, the ups and the downs
I'll still be here for u let me cater 2 u

Cause ur beautiful
I luv the way u r
Fulfill ur every desire
Ur wish is my command
I wanna cater 2 my man

Ur heart, so pure
Ur love shines through
The darkness will get through
So much of me is u
I wanna cater 2 my man

Let me cater 2 u cause baby this is ur day
Do anything for my man baby u blow me away
I got ur slippers, ur dinner, ur dessert and so much more
Anything u want let me cater 2 u

Inspire me from the heart can't nuthin' tear us apart
Ur all I want in a man, I put my life in ur hands
I got ur slippers, ur dinner, ur dessert and so much more
Anything u want I want 2 cater 2 u
