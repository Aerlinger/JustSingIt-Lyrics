You know very well who you are
Youre the only one, youve got my heart
Youve had a few, boy one too many
But Im the only one to wake you up

[Chorus]
I reminisced the way we kissed, it felt so personal
You took the chance to win my love and now you know
(it was all a dream)
I dont need no one baby
Without you Im incomplete
My love is just like the bar
Put it all on me
I don't want nobody else
Baby all need is you
(You are the one I want)
And I don't want nobody else
Baby all need is you
You are the one I want

You know very well, youre a star
Cause I dont go that far, look where we are
And ain't none like you, one in a million
But Im the only one to count you on

[Chorus]
I reminisced the way we kissed, it felt so personal
You took the chance to win my love and now you know
(it was all a dream)
That I don't need no one baby
Without you Im incomplete
My love is just like the bar
Put it all on me
Yeah

I don't want nobody else
Baby all I need is you
You are the one I want
I don't want nobody else
Baby all I need is you
You are the one I want

[Chorus]
I reminisced the way we kissed, it felt so personal
You took thechance to win my love and now you know
I dont even know one baby
Without you Im incomplete
My love is just like the
Put it all on me
Yeah
Put it all on me baby
Put it all on me
Yeah, yeah
