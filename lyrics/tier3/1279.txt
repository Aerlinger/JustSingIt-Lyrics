Have you seen my hands
Just look at 'em shake
And the song just keeps on repeating
Drop the needle again
And I dance with your ghost
Oh but that ain't the way
I can't move on & I can't stay the same
And all my friends say
Hey turn the record over
Hey I'll see you on the flip side
There you go
Turn the key & engine over
Let her go
Let somebody else lay at her feet
But have you seen my heart
Have you seen how it bleeds
And the nights are so long baby
Out here in the deep
The tick, ticking of hours lonely
I hear the alarm
I used to hear when she would sleep in my arms
But better sense says
Hey turn the record over
Hey I'll see you on the flip side
There you go
Turn the key & engine over
Let her go
Let somebody else lay at her feet
And all my friends say
Hey turn the record over
Hey I'll see you on the flip side
There you go
Turn the key & engine over
Let her go
Let somebody else lay at my feet
Where you used to be
Where you used to be
Where you used to be
Here with me

Fallon, Brian
