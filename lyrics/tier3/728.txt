Ooh yeah
Yahoo hoo

I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
Wanna love that is based on truth not just dare

You'll not hurt my pride if right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine in the light and the dark

If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
If you need me prove it

If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
If you need me prove it

You see now actions speak louder than words
So don't just say things that I've already heard
Don't want your body without your soul
I don't want a love who will come here and go

You'll not hurt my pride if right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart then it's time that you start
To act like you're mine in the light and the dark

If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
If you need me prove it

If you love me say it
If you trust me do it
If you want me show it
Prove it

If you love me say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it

Say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it

Oh I, oh I, I wanna touch you baby
And spread my love all around you, honey
And if you come, you gotta show, baby
True love to share

Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it

Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it

Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it

Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it

Show it
Prove it
Say it
Do it

Show it
Prove it

Say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it

Say it
Do it
Show it
Prove it
