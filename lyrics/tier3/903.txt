I was brought up to believe
The universe has a plan
We are only human
It's not ours to understand

The universe has a plan
All is for the best
Some will be rewarded
And the devil will take the rest

All is for the best
Believe in what we're told
Blind men in the market
Buying what we're sold

Believe in what we're told
Until our final breath
While our loving Watchmaker
Loves us all to death

In a world of cut and thrust
I was always taught to trust
In a world where all must fail
Heaven's justice will prevail

The joy and pain that we receive
Each comes with its own cost
The price of what we're winning
Is the same as what we've lost

All is for the best
Believe in what we're told
Blind men in the market
Buying what we're sold

Believe in what we're told
Until our final breath
While our loving Watchmaker
Loves us all to death

Until our final breath
The joy and pain that we receive
Must be what we deserve
I was brought up to believe

Until our final breath
The joy and pain that we receive
Must be what we deserve
I was brought up to believe

All is for the best
Believe in what we're told
Blind men in the market
Buying what we're sold

Believe in what we're told
Until our final breath
While our loving Watchmaker
Loves us all to

Believe in what we're told
Until our final breath
While our loving Watchmaker
Loves us all to
Loves us all to death
