13 Uh, Uh ,Uh oh0 * 52 You were in college working part time waiting tables36 Left a small town, never looked back* 42 I was a flight risk with a fear of falling* 51 Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts0 25 I say can you believe it?27 As we're lying on the couch25 The moment I could see it26 Yes, yes, I can see it now0 * 51 Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?* 45 You put your arm around me for the first time* 53 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter* 44 You are the best thing that's ever been mine0 * 52 Flash forward and we're taking on the world together* 47 And there's a drawer of my things at your place* 55 You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded* 45 You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes0 23 But we got bills to pay26 We got nothing figured out24 When it was hard to take38 Yes, yes, this is what I thought about0 * 51 Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?* 45 You put your arm around me for the first time* 53 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter* 44 You are the best thing that's ever been mine0 * 49 Do you remember all the city lights on the water?* 46 You saw me start to believe for the first time* 53 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter* 44 You are the best thing that's ever been mine0 36 And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m.* 49 As everything was slipping right out of our hands* 56 I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street0 29 Braced myself for the goodbye33 'Cause that's all I've ever known28 Then you took me by surprise35 You said I'll never leave you alone0 * 52 You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water* 54 And every time I look at you, it's like the first time* 53 I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter* 43 She is the best thing that's ever been mine0 21 Hold on, make it last24 Hold on, never turn back* 53 You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter* 44 You are the best thing that's ever been mine0 18 Do you believe it?23 We're gonna make it now12 I can see it16 I can see it now0 11 Songwriters13 SWIFT, TAYLOR0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 51 Read more: Taylor Swift - Mine Lyrics | MetroLyrics
