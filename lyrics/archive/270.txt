	<li><p>This time I wonder what it feels like</p></li>
	<li><p>To find the one in this life</p></li>
	<li><p>The one we all dream of</p></li>
	<li><p>But dreams just aren't enough</p></li>
	<li><p>So I'll be waiting for the real thing</p></li>
	<li><p>I'll know it by the feeling</p></li>
	<li><p>The moment when we're meeting</p></li>
	<li><p>Will play out like a scene straight off the silver screen</p></li>
	<li><p>So I'll be holdin’ my breath</p></li>
	<li><p>Right up to the end</p></li>
	<li><p>Until that moment when</p></li>
	<li><p>I find the one that I'll spend forever with</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause nobody wants to be the last one there</p></li>
	<li><p>'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares</p></li>
	<li><p>Someone to love with my life in their hands</p></li>
	<li><p>There's gotta be somebody for me like that</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause nobody wants to go it on their own</p></li>
	<li><p>And everyone wants to know they're not alone</p></li>
	<li><p>Somebody else that feels the same somewhere</p></li>
	<li><p>There's gotta be somebody for me out there</p></li>
	<li><p>Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight</p></li>
	<li><p>And damn it, this feels too right</p></li>
	<li><p>It's just like déjà vu</p></li>
	<li><p>Me standin’ here with you</p></li>
	<li><p>So I'll be holdin' my breath</p></li>
	<li><p>Could this be the end?</p></li>
	<li><p>Is it that moment when</p></li>
	<li><p>I find the one that I spend forever with?</p></li>
	<li><p>‘Cause nobody wants to be the last one there</p></li>
	<li><p>‘Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares</p></li>
	<li><p>Someone to love with my life in their hands</p></li>
	<li><p>There's gotta be somebody for me like that</p></li>
	<li><p>‘Cause nobody wants to go it on their own</p></li>
	<li><p>And everyone wants to know they're not alone</p></li>
	<li><p>Is there somebody else that feels the same somewhere?</p></li>
	<li><p>There's gotta be somebody for me out there</p></li>
	<li><p>Ooh, you can't give up</p></li>
	<li><p>(When you're lookin' for) a diamond in the rough</p></li>
	<li><p>(because you never know) when it shows up</p></li>
	<li><p>Make sure you're holdin' on</p></li>
	<li><p>‘Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on</p></li>
	<li><p>‘Cause nobody wants to be the last one there</p></li>
	<li><p>And everyone wants to feel like someone cares</p></li>
	<li><p>Someone to love with my life in their hands</p></li>
	<li><p>There’s gotta be somebody for me</p></li>
	<li><p>Oh</p></li>
	<li><p>Nobody wants to go it on their own</p></li>
	<li><p>And everyone wants to know they're not alone</p></li>
	<li><p>Is there somebody else that feels the same somewhere?</p></li>
	<li><p>There's gotta be somebody for me out there</p></li>
	<li><p>Nobody wants to be the last one there</p></li>
	<li><p>And everyone wants to feel like someone cares</p></li>
	<li><p>Is there somebody else that feels the same somewhere?</p></li>
