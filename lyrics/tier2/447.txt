[Kelis' introduction:]
[Laughter]
Hey Ya,
You don't have love me,
you don't even have to like me,
but you will respect me,
you know why?
cause I'm a boss!

Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch that beat go...

[Chorus - Kelis:]
I'm bossy
I'm the first girl to scream on a track
I switched up the beat of the drum
That's right, I brought all the boys to the yard
And that's right, I'm the one that's tattooed on his arm
I'm bossy
I'm the bitch ya'll love to hate
I'm the chick that's raised the stake
I told young stunna he should switch to Bapes
I'm back with an 808 'cause I'm bossy

Ooh, lemme slow it down for ya can catch the flow (catch the flow)
Screw it up make it go extra slow (extra slow)
Real girls get down on the flo' (on the flo' get down, on the flo')
Ooh, I gave you a taste you want some more (touch down)
On it like a pro
I ride the beat like a bicycle, I'm icy cold
Ooh, from the 6-4 hoppers up in crenshaw
The money makin playas up in Harlem
Don't want no problem
We gon' keep it bumpin while the 808 is jumpin

Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill

[Chorus - Kelis]

Ooh, (I bet, I bet) I bet cha neva heard it like this before (this before)
My baby be cruisin them phantom doors (phantom doors)
Got the bar poppin this that you can't afford (can't afford)
Ooh, I'm drinkin, blastin the crowds, it's all smokin
All the while I'm all open
Me and my girls we stay fly and we love to stay high
Ooh, from the 6-4 hoppers up in crenshaw
To the money makin playas up in Harlem
Don't want no problems
We gon' keep it bumpin while the 808 is jumpin

Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill
Diamonds on my neck, di-diamonds on my grill

[Chorus - Kelis]

[Too $hort]
It's 'bout time that she get with me
Can't stop starin, she's fine and she's pretty
Damn girl, don't hurt 'em
If niggas don't get back, you gon work 'em
Put your mack down, I know your background
What chu want girl, you gettin mad now
That's how you do it, huh?
Well I'm the coolest one
In fact, it's in the back bring 'em to the front (bitch)
Tell that man you's a boss, bitch
Make some noise, raise your hand if you's a boss, bitch
I don't think he understands you's a boss, bitch
Get some help if you can 'cause he lost it
Ain't no refunds, she spent the cash mayne
In your Benz with her friends in the fast lane
Flossin, you say "How much it cost me?"
About a million dollars player, she's bossy

[Chorus - Kelis]

Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh... watch the beat go...
Uh uh...
