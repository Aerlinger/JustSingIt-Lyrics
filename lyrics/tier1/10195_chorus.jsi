[:chorus:]
I'll stand by you, i'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And i'll never desert you

I'll stand by you
And when, when the night falls on you, baby
You're feelin' all alone
You won't be on your own

[:chorus:]
I'll stand by you, i'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And i'll never desert you
