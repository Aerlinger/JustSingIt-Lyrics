25 Come a little closer baby27 I feel like layin' you down27 On a bed of sweet surrender28 Where we can work it all out0 39 There ain't nothin' that love can't fix38 Girl it's right here at our fingertips28 So come a little closer baby27 I feel like layin' you down0 25 Come a little closer baby22 I feel like lettin' go36 Of everything that stands between us28 And the love we used to know0 39 I wanna touch you like a cleansin' rain33 And let it wash all the hurt away28 So come a little closer baby22 I feel like lettin' go0 * 43 If there's still a chance then take my hand20 And we'll steal away* 46 Off into the night, until we make things right37 The sun's gonna rise, on a better day0 25 Come a little closer baby29 I feel like strippin' it down32 Back to the basics of you and me33 And what makes the world go round0 33 Every inch of you against my skin40 I wanna be stronger than we've ever been28 So come a little closer baby29 I feel like strippin' it down0 25 Come a little closer baby29 Just a little bit closer baby25 Come a little closer baby27 I feel like layin' you down0 11 Songwriters32 BEAVERS, BRETT / BENTLEY, DIERKS0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 69 Read more: Dierks Bentley - Come A Little Closer Lyrics | MetroLyrics
