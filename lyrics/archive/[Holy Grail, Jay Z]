[Holy Grail, Jay Z]

[Intro]
You'd take the clothes off my back and I'd let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth and I'd watch you eat it
I still donĂ„â€šĂ‹ Ä‚Ë Ă˘â‚¬ĹˇĂ‚Â¬Ä‚Ë Ă˘â‚¬ĹľĂ‹ t know why, why I love you so much, ohh
You curse my name, in spite to put me to shame
Have my laundry in the streets, dirty or clean, give it up for fame
But I still don't know why, why I love it so much

[Hook]
And baby, it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair, sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail

[Verse 1]
Blue told me remind you niggers
Fuck that shit y'all talking 'bout, I'm the nigger
Caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer
God damn it it I like it
Bright lights is enticing but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night, thirty mil' for one fight
But soon as all the money blows, all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame, keep cheating on me, what I do, I took her back
Fool me twice, that's my bad, I can't even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder, momma' please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame, Kurt Cobain, I did it to myself

[Bridge]
And we all just, entertainers
And we're stupid, and contagious
And we all just, entertainers

[Hook]
And baby, it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair, sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail

[Verse 2]
Now I got tattoos on my body, psycho bitches in my lobby
I got haters in the paper, photo shoots with paparazzi
Can't even take my daughter for a walk, see 'em by the corner store
I feel like I'm cornered off enough is enough, I'm calling this off
Who the fuck I'm kidding though, I'm getting high, sitting low
Sliding by in that big body, curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain works, I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with, nigger deal with, this shit ain't work
This light work, camera snapping, my eyes hurt
Niggers dying back where I was birthed, fuck your IRIS and the IRS
Get the hell up off your high horse
You got the shit that niggers die for, dry yours
Why you mad, take the good with the bad
Don't throw the baby out with the bath water
You still alive, still that nigger
Nigger you survived, you still getting bigger nigger
Living the life, Vanilla wafers in a villa
Illest nigger alive, Michael Jackson's Thriller

[Hook]
And baby, it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair, sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail

[Bridge]
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart, just so you can watch me bleed
And I still donĂ„â€šĂ‹ Ä‚Ë Ă˘â‚¬ĹˇĂ‚Â¬Ä‚Ë Ă˘â‚¬ĹľĂ‹ t know why, why I love you so much, yeah
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink with guess whose name
But I still don't know why, why our love is so much

[Hook]
And baby, it's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair, sipping from your cup 'til it runneth over, Holy Grail

[Ending]
Ooooooooohhhhhh, woooowwww (Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Grail)
Ooooooooohhhhhh, oooohhhh, woooowwww (Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Holy Grail)
Ooooooooohhhhhh, don't know why......
