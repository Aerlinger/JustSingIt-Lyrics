This old man and me were at the bar and we
Were havin' us some beers and swappin' I don't cares
Talkin' politics, blonde and red head chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and habits we ain't kicked

We talked about God's grace and all the hell we raised
Then I heard the ol' man say
God is great, beer is good and people are crazy

He said I fought two wars, been married and divorced
What brings you to Ohio? He said damned if I know
We talked an hour or two about every girl we knew
What all we put 'em through like two old boys will do

We pondered life an death, he lit a cigarette
He said these damn things will kill me yet
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy

Last call it's 2 a.m., I said goodbye to him, I never talked to him again
Then one sunny day, I saw the old mans face
Front page obituary, he was a millionaire
He left his fortune to some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as hell, but me I am doing well

And I dropped by today to just say thanks and pray
And I left a six pack right there on his grave
And I said God is great, beer is good and people are crazy

God is great, beer is good and people are crazy
God is great, beer is good and people are crazy
