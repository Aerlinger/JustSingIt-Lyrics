Ran into an old friend yesterday
Caught me by surprise when he called my name
He was a familiar face
From a chapter in my past

Talked for a while, asked him how he's been
Said that he was seeing somebody
And told me this was gonna last
Showing me her photograph

And all the feelings I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

Truth is, I never got over you
Truth is, wish I was standing in her shoes
Truth is, and when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

Truth is, I never should have let you go
Truth is, and it's killing me 'cause, now I know
Truth is, when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

We reminisce on the way things used to be
Shared a couple laughs, and some memories
Talked about the things that changed
Some for good and some for bad

Then he said, "Goodbye" and he paid for lunch
Promised that we'd always keep in touch
Grabbed my bags and grabbed my thoughts
Walked away and that was that

And all the feelings I thought were gone
Came rushing back to me at once
Tried to smile and hide the way I felt
But I was thinking to myself

Truth is, I never got over you
Truth is, wish I was standing in her shoes
Truth is, and when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

Truth is, I never should have let you go
Truth is, and it's killing me 'cause, now I know
Truth is, when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

Now the truth is, it hurts
But I know that the fault's mine
'Cause I let him go

Tried to get over it
But it's messing with my mind
Because I know

Truth is, I never got over you
Truth is, wish I was standing in her shoes
Truth is, and when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

Truth is, I never should have let you go
Truth is, but it's killing me 'cause now I know
Truth is, but when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

Truth is, truth is
Truth is, wish I was standing in her shoes
Truth is, when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

Truth is, I never should have let you go
Truth is, killing me 'cause now I know
Truth is, but when it's all said and done
Guess I'm still in love with you

I just gotta be honest, I guess
I, I guess I'm still in love, in love
