I can see your mouth move
But I don't hear the words
And while you dig yourself a hole
You're burying me in the blur
I can taste the fake, the shame
I've heard this story before
And while you dig yourself a hole
It's the same s**t, different girl

When I was building a home, you made a bed of your own, or perfectly the life of three
But now your cover is blown, you get to be on your own, and find another stupid girl like me

So go out and party, cuz I'm just getting started
And I'm dancing to a brand new beat
It gets stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat
Gets stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat

So go out and party, like you're not broken-hearted
Cuz you're now one just mistake on my beat
It gets stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat
Gets stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat

I wanna know, was I the one?
Or just the chick on the side
I gave it all, put down my walls
You dare say I didn't try
But you won't stop, stop telling me what, what you think I want to know
I'm ejecting the sign of you deleting the thought of you record this, or what you may call

When I was building a home, you made a bed of your own, or perfectly the life of three
But now your cover is blown, you get to be on your own, and find another stupid girl like me

So go out and party, cuz I'm just getting started
And I'm dancing to a brand new beat
It gets stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat
Gets stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat

So go out and party, like you're not broken-hearted
Cuz you're now one just mistake on my beat
It gets stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat
Gets stuck on repeat, repeat, repeat
