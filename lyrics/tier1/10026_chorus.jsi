[:chorus:]
Say it ain't so, i will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Late night, come home
Work sucks, i know
She left me roses by the stairs
Surprises let me know she cares

[:chorus:]
Say it ain't so, i will not go
Turn the lights off, carry me home
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
