12 I never knew* 48 I never knew that everything was falling through* 43 That everyone I knew was waiting on a queue* 47 To turn and run when all I needed was the truth0 29 But that's how it's got to be* 44 It's coming down to nothing more than apathy* 46 I'd rather run the other way than stay and see* 49 The smoke and who's still standing when it clears0 25 And everyone knows I'm in26 Over my head, over my head30 Eight seconds left in overtime38 She's on your mind, she's on your mind0 15 Let's rearrange* 44 I wish you were a stranger I could disengage* 42 To say that we agree and then never change40 Soften a bit until we all just get along0 20 But that's disregard35 Find another friend and you discard39 As you lose the argument in a cable car* 41 Hanging above as the canyon comes between0 25 And everyone knows I'm in26 Over my head, over my head35 With eight seconds left in overtime38 She's on your mind, she's on your mind0 21 Everyone knows I'm in26 Over my head, over my head35 With eight seconds left in overtime32 She's on your mind, she's on, oh0 * 41 And suddenly I become a part of your past37 I'm becoming the part that don't last34 I'm losing you and it's effortless0 15 Without a sound* 47 We lose sight of the ground in the throw around* 46 Never thought that you wanted to bring it down* 49 I won't let it go down till we torch it ourselves0 25 And everyone knows I'm in26 Over my head, over my head35 With eight seconds left in overtime38 She's on your mind, she's on your mind0 33 Everyone knows she's on your mind34 Everyone knows I'm in over my head32 I'm in over my head, I'm over my0 21 Everyone knows I'm in26 Over my head, over my head35 With eight seconds left in overtime38 She's on your mind, she's on your mind0 11 Songwriters27 King, Joseph / Slade, Isaac0 12 Published by* 57 Lyrics Â© EMI Music Publishing, Another Victory Publishing0 0 0 * 62 Read more: Fray - Over My Head(cable Car) Lyrics | MetroLyrics
