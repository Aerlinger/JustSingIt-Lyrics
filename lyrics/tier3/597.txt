Whos to know if your soul will fade at all?
The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self-esteem along the way, yeah

Good god, you're comin up with reasons
Good god, you're draggin it out
And good god, it's the changin of the seasons
I feel so raped, so follow me down and just

Fake it, if youre out of direction
Fake it, if you don't belong, yeah
Fake it, if you feel like infection
Whoa, youre such a fuckin hypocrite

You should know that the lies won't hide your flaws
No sense in hiding all of yours
You gave up on your dreams along the way, yeah

Good god, you're comin up with reasons
Good god, you're draggin it out
And good god, it's the changin of the seasons
I feel so raped so follow me down and just

Fake it, if youre out of direction
Fake it, if you don't belong, yeah
Fake it, if you feel like infection
Whoa, youre such a fuckin hypocrite

I can fake with the best of anyone
I can fake with the best of them all
I can fake with the best of anyone
I can fake it all

Whos to know if your soul will fade at all?
The one you sold to fool the world
You lost your self-esteem along the way, yeah

Good god, you're comin up with reasons
Good god, you're draggin it out
Good god, it's the changin of the seasons
I feel so raped, man, follow me down and just

Fake it, if youre out of direction
Fake it, if you don't belong, yeah
Fake it, if you feel like infection
Whoa, youre such a fuckin hypocrite

Fake it, if youre out of direction
Fake it, if you don't belong, yeah
Fake it, if you feel like infection
Whoa, youre such a fuckin hypocrite
