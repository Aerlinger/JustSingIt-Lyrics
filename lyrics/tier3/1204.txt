It's okay, I'm good
Let's go

Yeah, yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast, a celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out

Let it rain, let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

Yeah, I'm in charge now
I'm a star and I brought my fuckin' cast out
I live a very, very, very wild lifestyle
Heidi and Audrina eat your heart out

I used to listen to you, don't wanna bring arms house
I got so many clothes, I keeps some in my aunt's house
Disturbing London baby, we about to branch out
Soon I'll be the king like Prince Charles child

Yeah, yeah and there ain't nobody fresher
Semester to semester, ravin' with the fresher's
20 light bulbs around my table on my dresser
ClC Kompressor, just in case that don't impress her

Say hello to Dexter, say hello to uncle Fester
Got them gazing at my necklace and my crazy sun protectors
G-shocks, I got a crazy thumb collection
Haters, I can't fuckin' hear your reception

Yeah, yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast, a celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out

Let it rain, let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

Yeah, this shit was meant to last me 24 hours man
Ok

Yeah, they say hello, they say hola, and they say bonjour
I'm pissed, I never got to fly on a Concord
I been Southampton but I've never been to Scunthorpe
I'm fuckin' crazy with the kicks, call me Jean Claude

I'm 'bout to be a bigger star than my mum thought
'Cause every day I got a groupie at my front door
Now I drive past the bus I used to run for
Where's my fucking clap, where's my encore?

I walk alone 'cause I was born alone
I chirps her just for fun, I'll never ever call her phone
I'll leave her in the club, I'll never ever walk her home
DL the fuckin' foundation, I'm the cornerstone

I'm born famous, I'm sorta known
If your son doesn't, I bet your daughter knows
Check out my visual, check out my audio
Extraordinary, yo, hope you enjoy the show

Yeah, yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast, a celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out

Let it rain, let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

Uh, look at me, I been a cheeky bastard, man and
Look at all the drama we started, now I'm
In here layin' on my back
Sayin' DJ, won't ya gimmie one more track?

Let it rain, let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

Let it rain, let it pour away
We won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out

Pass out
