Ever since the day you went away and left me lonely and cold
My life just hasn't been the same, oh baby, no
When I looked into your eyes the moment that I let you go
I just broke down

Baby if I ever get the chance to be with you again
I would sacrifice 'cuz the feeling that I feel within
No other man would ever make me feel so right

It's nice to smile when I get your phone call at night
But I'd rather have you here with me, right next to me
I miss the way you hold me tight

I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you I'd cross the world, for you I'd do anything

That's right baby, I'm going crazy
I need to be your lady, I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me, I'm in love with you baby

That's right baby, I'm going crazy
I need to be your lady, I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me, I'm in love with you baby

Break it down now, I'll tell you what I feel
From the moment that I met you its been so damn real
My heart seems to skip another beat
Every time we speak, I can't believe I feel so weak

Tell me that you really need me
And you want me and you miss me and you love me, I'm your lady
I'll be around waiting for you I'll put it down be the woman for you

I'm falling so deep for you crazy over for you
I`m calling, calling out to you, what am I going to do? It's true, no fronting
It's you and no other I can no longer go on without you
I'll just break down

I gotta let you know I feel so weak without your touch
I never thought that I could ever love a man so much
I gotta let you know I think that we are destiny
For you I'd cross the world, for you I'd do anything

That's right baby, I'm going crazy
I need to be your lady, I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me, I'm in love with you baby

That's right baby, I'm going crazy
I need to be your lady, I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me, I'm in love with you baby

Crazy, lady, lately
Baby

Baby, that's right baby, I'm going crazy
I need to be your lady, I've been thinking lately
That you and me, yes we can make it
Just ride with me, roll with me, I'm in love with you baby
