Mmm mmm, yeah
Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Oh yeah

Gotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cuz right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone

And I know it makes no sense
'Cuz you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore

(It's ridiculous)
It's been months
And for some reason I just
(Can't get over us)
And I'm stronger than this, yeah

(Enough is enough)
No more walkin' round
With my head down
(Yeah)
I'm so over being blue
Cryin' over you

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

Gotta fix that calendar I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary

I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be

That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?

(Leave me alone)
Leave me alone
(Stupid love songs)
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
I'm letting go
Turning off the radio

'Cuz I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
She was still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing
She was still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
Why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)

And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishin'
You were still here

Said I'm so sick of love songs
So sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)
Why can't I turn off the radio?
