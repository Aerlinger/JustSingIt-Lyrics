It's been so long, I've been out of my body with you
I feel alone, feel at home, feel like nothing is true
You took me to a place where my senses gave way
Turn it round, shut it down, what the people say
Climbing up, killin' time, let 'em give you some
Take my hand and let it come, let it come, let it

Take it back when she knows that you're doing it right
'Cause everybody else knows what they're taking tonight

But I just wanna play it right
We, we're gonna get there tonight

It's been so far, I've been walking the line on my own
Lift me up to the stars, we are coming home
I know we had a chase but we're out of time
We have sold in the cold, physical design
Set me free, set me out on the run
Lift me up to the sun, to the sun, to the

When you're burning down, when you're burning down
It's the way that you fake it, I know it's too late

But I just wanna play it right
We, we're gonna get there tonight
I just wanna take you down
We, we're gonna bring you 'round

I just wanna play it right
We, we're gonna get there tonight
I just wanna take you down
We, we're gonna bring you 'round
