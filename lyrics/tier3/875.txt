Oh love,Oh love, won't you rain on me tonight?
Oh life, Oh life, please dont pass me by.
Don't stop, don't stop,
Don't stop,When the red lights flash.
Oh ride, free ride,
Wont you take me close to you?
Far away,
Far away,
Waste away tonight,
I'm wearing my heart on a noose.
Far away,
Far away
Waste away tonight.
Tonight my hearts on the loose.
Oh lights,
And action,
I just can't be satisfied.
Oh losers,
And choosers,
Won't you please hold on my life?
Oh hours,
And hours,
Like the dog years of the day.
Old story,
Same old story,
Won't you see the light of day.
Far away,
Far away,
Waste away tonight,
I'm wearing my heart on a noose.
Far away,
Far away,
Waste away tonight,
Tonight my hearts on the loose.
Talk myself out of feeling.
Talk my way out of control.
Talk myself out of falling in love,
Falling in love with you.
Oh love,
Oh love,
Won't you rain on me tonight?
Oh ride,
Free ride,
Won't you take me close to you.
Far away,
Far away,
Waste away tonight.
I'm wearing my heart on a noose.
Far away,
Far away,
Waste away tonight.
Tonight my hearts on the loose
Far away,
Far away,
Waste away tonight.
I'm wearing my heart on a noose.
Far away,
Far away,
Waste away tonight.
Tonight my hearts on the loose.
Tonight my hearts on the loose.
Tonight my hearts on the loose.
