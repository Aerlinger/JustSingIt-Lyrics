I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, talk dirty when you talk, talk

Dirty talk

Kitten heels, lingerie, pantyhose, foreplay
Legs up on the bar, in the back of your car
Latex, champagne, bubble bath, whipped cream
Cherry pop, tag team, can you make me scream?

I wanna do some dirty things to you tonight
I wanna fight all through the night, night, night

I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, talk dirty when you talk, talk

Dirty Talk

Blindfold, feather bed, tickle me, slippery
G-spot, nasty pose in a video
Love machine, by myself, climax, hot wax
S&M, on the floor, I like it hardcore

I wanna do some dirty things to you tonight
I wanna fight all through the night, night, night

I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, talk dirty when you talk, talk

I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, talk dirty when you talk

When you dirty talk

Can you go down?
Are you up for it, baby?
Can you turn me out?
Are you up for it?

Talk to me, talk to me
Talk dirty to me, talk dirty to me
Won't you talk to me, talk to me?
Talk dirty to me, talk dirty

Dirty talk

I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, talk dirty when you talk, talk

I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, talk dirty when you talk, talk

Dirty talk
