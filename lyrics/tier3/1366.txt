Weight is coming off
Soaring high
Pleading you to stay
Come alive

Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you wanna try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you wanna

Once you get the feeling it
Wants you back for more
Says it's gonna heal it but
You won't make the call
One step back you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
'till it's gone?

Fading out the light
Softly say
Get it out my mind
Any way

Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you wanna try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you wanna

Once you get the feeling it
Wants you back for more
Says it's gonna heal it but
You won't make the call
One step back you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
'till it's gone?

Once you get the feeling it
Wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor
One step back you're leaving it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
'till it's gone?

You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go

You gave to me
All I know
I will stay here
I will not go

Say you mean it, seal it up
Say you wanna try
Say you haven't had enough
Say you wanna

Once you get the feeling it
Wants you back for more
Says it's gonna heal it but
You won't make the call
One step back you're leaving it
Now it's moving on
Why won't you believe in it
'till it's gone?

Once you get the feeling it
Wants you back for more
Now it gets ethereal
Feet ain't on the floor
One step back you're leaving it
Jumping at the wall
Why won't you believe in it
'till it's gone?
