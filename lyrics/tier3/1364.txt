I wanna settle down
I wanna settle down
Won't you settle down with me?
Settle down

We can settle at a table
A table for two
Won't you wine and dine with me?
Settle down

I wanna raise a child
I wanna raise a child
Won't you raise a child with me
Raise a child

We'll call her Nebraska
Nebraska Jones
She'll have your nose
Just so you know

I wanna settle down
I wanna settle down
Won't you settle down with me?
Settle down

Run from Angela Vickers
I saw her with you
Monday morning small talking on the avenue
She's got a fancy car
She wants to take you far
From the city lights and sounds deep into the dark

Star so light and star so bright
First star i see tonight
Star so light and star so bright
Keep him by my side

I wanna settle down
I wanna settle down
Baby there's no need to run
I'll love you well

I wanna settle down
It's time to bring you down
On just one knee for now
Lets make our vows
