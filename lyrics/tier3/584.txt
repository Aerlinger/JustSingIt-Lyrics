[Verse 1]
For my theme song
My leather black jeans on
My by any means on
Pardon I'm gettin' my scream on
Enter the kingdom
But watch who you bring home
They see a black man with a white woman
And at the top floor they gon come to kill King Kong
Middle America packed in
Came to see me in my black skin
Number one question you asking
Fuck every question you asking
If I don't get ran out by Catholics
Here come some conservative Baptists
Claiming I'm overreactin'
Like the black kids in Chiraq bitch

[Hook: 1]
Four the morning, and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where's the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it
And you know it

[Bridge]
So follow me up cause this shit about to go down
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go, now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would have been blacked out on your ass

[Hook: 2]
Four in the morning, and I'm zonin'
They say I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we livin' in the moment
I've been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it, and you know it

[Verse 2]
Stop all that coon shit
Early morning cartoon shit
This is goon shit
Fuck up your whole afternoon shit
I'm aware I'm a wolf
Soon as the moon hit
I'm aware I'm a king
Back out the tomb bitch
Black out the room bitch
Stop all that coon shit
These niggas ain't doin' shit
Them niggas ain't doin' shit
Come on homey what happened?
You niggas ain't breathing, you gasping
These niggas ain't ready for action
Ready, ready for action

[Hook: 3]
Four in the mornin', and I'm zonin'
I think I'm possessed, it's an omen
I keep it 300, like the Romans
300 bitches, where the Trojans?
Baby we're livin' in the moment
I been a menace for the longest
But I ain't finished, I'm devoted
And you know it
And you know it

[Bridge]
So follow me up cause this shit about to go down
I'm doin' 500, I'm outta control now
But there's nowhere to go, now
And there's no way to slow down
If I knew what I knew in the past
I would have been blacked out on your ass

[Outro]
God (x 11)
