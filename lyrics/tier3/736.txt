It's here and I like it
Ooh! Ha-ha! Ha-ha!
Big Will, K-Ci, y'all bringing it in
What?

It's here and I like it
Say what? What?
Say what? What?
Gonna pack the dance floor
And do what with it?
Rock the dance floor

Here it comes the party of a lifetime
31st of December
Man, I remember when the ball dropped for 90
Now it's 9-9, ten years behind me

Whats gonna happen? Don't nobody know
Well, see when the clock gets to 12-0-0
Chaos, the cops gonna block the street
Man who the hell cares? Just don't stop the beat

No time to sleep, yo it's on tonight
K-C, you feeling me right?
2-0-0-0
Will 2K

The new millennium, yo excuse me Willennium
It cant get thicker than this Big Will
Slick like Rick, I can't miss
And we gonna party like its 19, hold up it is

Here it comes, another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes, another year
Everyone, new millennium

There's a party tonight, everybody was drinkin'
The house was screamin' and the bass was shakin'
And it won't be long till everybody knowin'
That twelve o clock, the roof will be blowin'

Drinks on me, up the cups
And midnight comin' full thrust
And Dick Clark holdin' it down
And the second hand rollin' around

Hundred thousands deep, world wide press
Hate to be the man that gotta clean this mess
Same resolution, get the money
Ain't where we've been, it's where we gonna be

Get ready to hum Auld Lang Syne
'Cause a person that know the words is hard to find
First soul train line of the year
Four, three, two, one

It's here and I like it
Gonna pack the dance floor
Rock the dance floor

Here it comes, another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes, another year
Everyone, new millennium

Say yeah, yeah, say yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, say yeah, yeah
Say yeah, yeah, say yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I remember tryin' to count how old I'd be
When the clock struck twelve in the year two G
Medianoche finally near
This will be that anthem amongst the cheers

Just the man to usher it in, Big Will bringin' the heat
K-Ci bringin' the plan, ringin' it in
Waitin' for the ball to drop
That 2000 vault, we breakin' the lock

Let hip-hop keep blazin' the charts
May the past keep a warm spot in your heart
May the future hold more joy than pain
Hands in the air, waitin' for confetti to rain

It's here and I like it
Gonna pack the dance floor
Rock the dance floor

Here it comes, another year
Come on everyone, new millennium
Here it comes, another year
Everyone, new millennium

There's a party tonight, everybody was drinkin'
The house was screamin' and the bass was shakin'
And it won't be long till everybody knowin' at twelve o clock
At 12 o clock

Here it comes, another year
Everyone, new millennium
Here it comes, another year
Everyone, new millennium

True dat, true dat, true dat
Yo London, come on, yo Bangkok, come on, come on
LA, ha, ha, the NYC
Come on, say what? Say what?

Yo Philly, come on, hey
Hey Tokyo, come on
Everybody say, what now
Say what now, saw what now
Come on, come on, come on
