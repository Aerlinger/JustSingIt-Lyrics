[Intro:]
Ay, ay, ay
Good to see you, come on in, let's go
Yeah, let's go
Alright, alright
OK, uh, alright, OK
Alright, OK

Return of the Mack, get up!
What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isnt.
Looking for a better way to get up out of bed
Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me
Get up! Thrift shop, pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby. Sweater gang, nope, nope yall cant copy
Yup. Bad, moon walking, this here, is our party, my posse's been on Broadway,
And we did it, our way.
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet Im on.
Let that stage light go and shine on down, got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style.
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds,
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit hustler,
Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushing

Labels out here,
Now they cant tell me nothing
We give that to the people,
Spread it across the country
Labels out here,
Now they cant tell me nothing
We give it to the people,
Spread it across the country

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, well fight 'til its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
Like the ceiling cant hold us
Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, well fight 'til its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
Like the ceiling cant hold us

Now, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful.
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But thats what you get when Wu Tang raised you
Yall cant stop me, go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And Im eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome,
Caesar make you a believer. Now I never ever did it for a throne.
That validation comes from giving it back to the people. Now sing this song and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me
If I fall, they got me. Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves

Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, well fight 'til its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
Like the ceiling cant hold us
Here, we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, well fight 'til its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
Like the ceiling cant hold us

And so we put our hands up
And so we put our hands up

Let's go!

Na na na na na na na na (aha)
Hey
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na (that's right, feels good)
Hey
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na (it's alright)
(oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na
Ma-ckle-more

[Album version ending:]
Here we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, well fight 'til its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
Like the ceiling cant hold us
Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, well fight 'til its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling cant hold us
Like the ceiling cant hold us.

[Music video ending 2x:]
Let the night come, before the fight's won
Some might run against the test
But those that triumph, embrace the fight cause
Their fears then prove that courage exists

Hope [echo]
