Who's that whisperin' in the trees?
It's two sailors and they're on leave
Pipes and chains and swingin' hands
Who's your Daddy? Yes I am

Fat cat came to play
Now he can't run fast enough
You'd best stay away
When the pushers come to shove

Zoot suit riot
Throw back a bottle of beer
Zoot suit riot
Pull a comb through your coal black hair

Zoot suit riot
Throw back a bottle of beer
Zoot suit riot
Pull a comb through your coal black hair
Blow Daddy!

A whipped up jitterbuggin' brown eyed man
A stray cat frontin' up an eight-piece band
Cut me Sammy and you'll understand
In my veins hot music ran

You got me in a sway
And I want to swing you done
Now you sailors know
Where your women come for love

Zoot suit riot
Throw back a bottle of beer
Zoot suit riot
Pull a comb through your coal black hair

You're in a zoot suit riot
You're in a zoot suit riot
You're in a zoot suit riot

Oh, you got me in a sway
And I want to swing you done
Now you sailors know
Where your women come for love

Zoot suit riot
Throw back a bottle of beer
Zoot suit riot
Pull a comb through your coal black hair

Zoot suit riot
Throw back a bottle of beer
Zoot suit riot
Pull a comb through your coal black hair

You're in a zoot suit riot
You're in a zoot suit riot
You're in a zoot suit riot
