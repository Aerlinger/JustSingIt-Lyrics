Im out here on my own
Im giving it a go alone
Im begging on my knees
Is there a God to save me ?

Ive been a wretched soul
From my heart down to my toes
I was lost in my disease
And you were right there screaming

"Dont change when its too late"

Maybe I said the right things wrong
My one last shot was too far gone
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die

Maybe I pushed you way too far
To pull you back from where you are
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die

From the valley of the dead
Im hearing every word you said
Im trying to apologize
But I cant feel my feelings

Are you giving us some room to grow ?
Or digging us a deeper hole ?
You're killing any shred of hope
For us to believe in

"Dont change when its too late"

Maybe I said the right things wrong
My one last shot was too far gone
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die

Maybe I pushed you way too far
To pull you back from where you are
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die

I'm out here on my own
Im sick of being here alone
I know where I belong
But I cant find my way home

Find my way home...
Find my way home...
Find my way home...
Find my way !

Maybe I said the right things wrong
My one last shot was too far gone
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die

Maybe I pushed you way too far
To pull you back from where you are
But if I can I swear that I
Will live for you before I die

Will live for you before I die
I will live for you before I die
