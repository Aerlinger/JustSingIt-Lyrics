You can be my student
Give you schooling
Show you how to make it bounce like a bad check
I can be your teacher, I can teach ya
How to get straight A's
But you really wanna F
You can bite? Go fetch
I know what's right, but go left
Living in the night, but we hardly dream
In the club, going Charlie Sheen

A girl, you my B girl
C girl? I got this D girl
No need to spell it out, I'll make it easy
I'll have you yelling out your "ABCD"

I just wanna F, F, F (G)
I just wanna F, F, F (H)
I just wanna F, F, F (U)
I just wanna F, F, F

A girl, you my B girl
C girl? I got this D girl
No need to spell it out, I'll make it easy
I'll have you yelling out your "ABCD"

I just wanna F, F, F (G)
I just wanna F, F, F (H)
I just wanna F, F, F (U)
I just wanna F, F, F
