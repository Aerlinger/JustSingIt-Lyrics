You've got a nerve to be asking a favor
You've got a nerve to be calling my number, I know,
We've been through this before.
Can't you hear me I'm, calling out your name
Can't you see me i'm, pounding on your door

You've got a nerve to be asking a favor
You've got a nerve to be calling my number.
Can't you hear me I'm, beating on the wall
Can't you see me I'm, pounding on your door
Can't you hear me when I'm, calling out your name.

When I used to go out I would know everyone that I saw
Now I go out alone if I go out at all
When I used to go out I would know everyone that I saw
Now I go out alone if I go out at all
When I used to go out I would know everyone that I saw
Now I go out alone if I go out at all

You've got a nerve to be asking a favor
You've got a nerve to be calling my number, I know,
We've been through this before.
Can't you hear me I'm, beating on the wall
Can't you see me I'm, Pounding on your door
