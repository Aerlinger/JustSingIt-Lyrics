Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby

Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah

Show me, how you want it to be
Tell me baby
'Cause I need to know now, oh because

[chorus:]
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy you got me blinded
Oh pretty, baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it

Show me, how you want it to be
Tell me baby
'Cause I need to know now, oh because

[chorus:]
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

Oh baby, baby
Oh baby, baby
Ah, yeah, yeah

Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
Oh pretty baby
I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess, that my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

[chorus:]
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess, I still believe (Still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time

I must confess
(My loneliness is killing me)
That my loneliness
Is killing me now
(I must confess, I still believe)
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
(When I'm not with you I lose my mind)
And give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
