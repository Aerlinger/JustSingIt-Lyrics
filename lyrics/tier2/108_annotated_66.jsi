* 41 Once I rose above the noise and confusion* 42 Just to get a glimpse beyond this illusion* 46 I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high* 48 Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man0 * 48 Though my mind could think I still was a mad man* 56 I hear the voices when I'm dreamin', I can hear them say0 24 Carry on, my wayward son39 For there'll be peace when you are done27 Lay your weary head to rest21 Don't you cry no more0 35 Masquerading as a man with a reason37 My charade is the event of the season* 66 And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely means that I don't know33 On a stormy sea of moving emotion0 * 41 Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean* 62 I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say0 24 Carry on, my wayward son35 There'll be peace when you are done27 Lay your weary head to rest21 Don't you cry no more0 34 Carry on, you will always remember37 Carry on, nothing equals the splendor31 Now your life's no longer empty27 Surely heaven waits for you0 24 Carry on, my wayward son35 There'll be peace when you are done27 Lay your weary head to rest37 Don't you cry (don't you cry no more)0 11 Songwriters16 Livgren, Kerry A0 12 Published by29 Lyrics Â© EMI Music Publishing0 0 0 * 61 Read more: Kansas - Carry On Wayward Son Lyrics | MetroLyrics
