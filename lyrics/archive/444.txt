Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean

Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean

Dro, I'm clean in this b****
Now I'm finna shoulder lean in this b****
N**** buck, carbon 15 in this b****
This Grand Hustle team of kings is gettin' rich

I lean and get lit, lima bean 6
I take breath, the opposite of Primatene Mist
I ride 26 and let my 9 screens flip
Dro be watchin' Oprah, Mac, 9 up in a clip

Triple black Phantom n**** nah it ain't Tip
With Lucky Charms diamonds man but nah it ain't Flip
Can't bounce, okay then I let my shoulder lean
And I bet my car talk and I bet my motor clean

Suicide doors, brown Rover look like pork an' beans
Everybody know me in the club 'cause they smokin' me
Dro, h*** scopin' me, ice come from Boca Raton
Hundred carats have 'em froze for an eon

Red, black and white Chevy now I'm ridin' Deion
Put them lights off in my rims now I'm ridin' neon
Our cars look like crayon, h*** know I'm the man though
I can shoulder lean, I don't know how to dance though

Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean

Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean

First I let my wheels spin then I let my screen fall
Then I let my trunk beat at Greenbriar Mall, tall
How can I pimp a foe? Take that chick to Berlin
My chick break triggers after that we say they girlfriend

My girl got a girlfriend, Chevy blue like whirlwind
Name it's a drought on that boy, so I got that girl in
Pearl Benz, cockin' hammer, Arm and Hammer propaganda
Many think I'm pimpin' in linen and salamander sandals

Dirty South hot 'cause Atlanta, show killers with ammo
We ride Phantom, holla shawty for grammar
Yep, now I be on TV, BET, out the channel
Hood playa from Bankhead, I stay by Grandma Nana

I lay by my banana, dumpin' and punkin' monkeys
Don't nobody live with my mom but a bunch of junkies
Donut Dunkin'? Shawty, I ride glazed on the Haze
Gator green Chevy, gator guts, alligator J's

Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean

Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean

Lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean
Lean, lean, lean, lean, get ya shoulder shawty
Lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean, lean
Lean, lean, lean, lean, get ya shoulder shawty

Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean

Let me see you bounce right to left and let your shoulder lean
Let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean
Ay, get it right, two step and let your shoulder lean
Just let your shoulder lean, just let your shoulder lean, ay
