[:chorus:]
And i'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And i'll earn your trust
Makin' memories of us

I wanna honor your mother
And i wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention
Like a bad outlaw
And i wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better
Than it's ever been

[:chorus:]
And i'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And i'll earn your trust
Makin' memories of us
