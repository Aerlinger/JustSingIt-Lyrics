Sunday mornin', praise the dawnin'
It's just a restless feelin', by my side
Early dawnin', Sunday mornin'
It's just the wasted years so close behind

Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you, who will call
It's nothin' at all

Sunday mornin' and I'm fallin'
I've got a feelin', I don't want to know
Early dawnin', Sunday mornin'
(Early dawnin')
It's all the streets you crossed, not so long ago

Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you, who will call
It's nothin' at all

Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you, who will call
It's nothin' at all

Sunday mornin'
Sunday mornin'
Sunday mornin'
Sunday mornin'
