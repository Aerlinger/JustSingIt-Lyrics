Was an honest man
Asked me for the phone
Tried to take control
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way

We shared some ideas
All obsessed with fame
Says, we're all the same
Oh, I don't see it that way
I don't see it that way

Raised in Carolina
I'm not like that
Tryin' to remind her
When we go back

I missed the last bus
I'll take the next train
I'll try, but you see
It's hard to explain
I say the right thing
But act the wrong way
I like it right here
But I cannot stay

I'm watching TV
Forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young
And they are too old
The joke is on you
This place is a zoo
You're right, it's true

He said, he can't decide
I shake my head to say
Every thing's just great
Oh, I just can't remember
I just can't remember

Raised in Carolina
I'm not like that
Trying to remind her
When we go back

I say the right thing
But act the wrong way
I like it right here
But I cannot stay
I'm watching TV
Forget what I'm told
Well, I am too young
And they are too old

Oh, man cant you see
I'm ever so pleased
Pretend to be nice
So I can be mean
I missed the last bus
We'll take the next train
I'll try, but you see
It's hard to explain
