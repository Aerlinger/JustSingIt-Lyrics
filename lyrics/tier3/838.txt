[Lily Allen]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
Said you going to bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleepin and I was hoping

[T Pain]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning, and I want ya
And you want me, don't ya?
I can see it
Cause you've been waiting on me since
I said that I was hittin' the club
Something coming up on me
And I know you be getting so horny
Cause you be sending me texts
Like boy just get your ass up in that car
And come get all of this love

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
You ain't got to remind me
She already said if I don't come home on time
She might go crazy
And she'll be waiting on me naked
With one of my chains on
She might come and find me
And then ask me kindly
Do I want her to go crazy?
We do this every night
And then we always wake up singing the same song

[Hook - Lily Allen]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring (talk to me girl)
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleepin
And I was hoping you would creep in

[Hook 2 - T-Pain]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck up to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleepin
And I was hoping you would creep in

[T-Pain]
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
And you calling
And these females got me stalling
I can hear your voice in my head like
"What is he doing?" oh what is he doing?

Cause I keep checking my cell phone
And these missed calls
You texting me like I'mma kill y'all
If you don't get your ass up out of that club
And you do know what time it is

(It's 5 o'clock in the morning)
On my bed, girl
And this Nuvo got me trippin
And I know that you mad, girl
But you ain't got to worry about nothing
Girl I got you, girl I got you
She might come and find me, and then ask me kindly
Do I want her to go crazy
We do this every night and then
We always wake up singing the same song

[Hook - Lily Allen]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleepin
And I was hoping you would creep in

[Hook 2 - T-Pain]

[Wiz Khalifa]
You ain't got nothing on
But the t-shirt that I left over your house
The last time I came and put it on ya
Too many thirsty girls up in this club for me to
Leave here with one of them
That's why I call her
And you'll be right at home waiting for me
Iphone plugged in the wall, just waiting for me
Club closed at 6, left around 4:30
Yeah so by the time I'm at your crib..
(It's 5o Clock in the morning)
And you yawning, but I've been drinking all night and I feel like performing
With you in the bedroom
Flooring to the dresser
Dont want nothing less cause I'm sure you're the best
You're the one, So I let you
Thats how you show me love
And when we finish you like "damn, babe you woke me up"
I like you way you put it down likes its for both of us
The sun aint the only thing thats coming up

[Hook]
It's 5 o' clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleepin
And I was hoping you would creep in
