Caught, I'm cold, hiding from you
And the skin so old.
I'll come clean
Everyone - everyone knows it's me.

And if I recover, will you be my comfort?
Or it can be over, or we can just leave it here.
So pick any number, choose any colour
I've got the answer, open me and follow.

I'll give you one more chance
Say you can change our heart
Where can you take what you need?
And you don't need me.
I'll give you one more chance
Say you can change our old ways
Can you take what you need?
And you know you don't need me.

Glow by blow
Honest in every way I know.
You appear to face the decision I
Know you fear.

And if I recover, will you be my comfort?
Or it can be over, or we can just leave it here.
So pick any number, choose any colour
I've got the answer, open me and follow.

I'll give you one more chance
Say you can change our heart
Where can you take what you need?
And you don't need me.
I'll give you one more chance
Say you can change our old ways
Can you take what you need?
And you know you don't need me.

But you know you don't need me.

And if I recover, will you be my comfort?
Or it can be over, or we can just leave it here.
So pick any number, choose any colour
I've got the answer, open me and follow.

I'll give you one more chance
Say you can change our heart
Where can you take what you need?
And you don't need me.
I'll give you one more chance
Say you can change our old ways
Can you take what you need?
And you know you don't need me.
