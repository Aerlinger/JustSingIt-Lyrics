Bone Thugs, Akon yeah

You know though, nothin' come easy
You gotta try real, real hard
I tried hard but I guess I gotta try harder

I tried so hard, can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard but always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hopin one day you'll come and rescue me

But until then I'll be posted up right here rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

First let me explain that I'm just a black man
And I come from the darkside
So I'm havin a hard time stayin' on track man
My mind be racin' and I don't even know what I'm chasin yet
Been in and out of relationships
I'm startin' to see that it's me where the complication's at

But I'm layin' back prayin' that you get that piece of mind of me
I thought I was right but really I'm wrong
Then again I was too blind to see
I was in the fast lane chasin my dream
And then it seemed when the fame and cash came they just got me

Goin' crazy, lately I been so faded tryna erase it
But I just can't cause the drama just grows greater
And I been in so many collisions from puttin **** off till later

I tried so hard, can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard but always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hopin one day you'll come and rescue me

But until then I'll be posted up right here rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

It's like I'm takin five steps forward and ten steps back
Tryin get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track
And I keep runnin away the ones that say they love me the most
How could I create the distance when it's supposed to be close?

And uh I just don't know but I be out here fightin demons
And it's like a curse that I can't shake this part of Cleveland
And Lord would you help me?
And stop this pain I keep inflinctin on my family

Hustlin and gamblin, drinkin' and scramblin'
And losin sight of what I supposed to be handlin'
It's hard to manage cause every days a challenge
And man, I'm slippin can't lose my balance, Im tryin not to panic

I tried so hard, can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard but always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hopin one day you'll come and rescue me

But until then I'll be posted up right here rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough

I see thangs won't change, I'm stuck in the game
As soon as I get out, it keeps pullin me back man
Got me doin' dirty dirt, so used to this hustlin' money
That I don't understand no nine to five work

Studied on the streets, hustlers know what I mean
Thugsters ballin' before us, I'm tryna make that major league
So we never leave, never 'til the sun came up
Gotta get it, no no leavin no grudge

Today games they play
Gotta go hard to get what you put in
If you fall off then its all on you
Gotta watch what you sign too
Try so hard but I won't play the fool

I tried so hard, can't seem to get away from misery
Man, I tried so hard but always be a victim of these streets
It ain't my fault cause I tried to get away but trouble follows me
And still I try so hard hopin one day you'll come and rescue me

But until then I'll be posted up right here rain, sleet, hail, snow
But until then I'll be posted up right here with my heat gettin dough
