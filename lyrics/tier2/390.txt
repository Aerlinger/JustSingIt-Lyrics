C I A R A, come on

Pull up your pants, just like him
Take out the trash, just like him
Getting your cash like him, fast like him
Girl you wanna act like he did

Im talking 'bout, security codes on everything
On vibrate so your phone dont ever ring
A foreign account
And another one he dont know about

Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be that
Tell you I love you but when you call, I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me, like 'Where you be at?'
'Cuz Im out, four in the morning on the corner rolling doing my own thing

What if I had a thing on the side, made you cry
Would the rules change up or would they still apply
If I played you like a toy?
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Cant be getting mad, but you mad, cant handle that?
Cant be getting mad, but you mad, cant handle that?

Girl go ahead and be just like him
Go run the streets just like him
Go home missin' sleep like 'em, creep like 'em
Front wit' you friends, act hard when you with them like him

Keep a straight face when you tell a lie
Always keep an air tight alibi
Keep it hid in the dark
What he dont know wont break his heart

Wish we could switch up the roles and I could be that
Tell you I love you but when you call, I never get back
Would you ask them questions like me, like 'Where you be at?'
'Cuz Im out, four in the morning on the corner rolling doing my own thing

What if I had a thing on the side, made you cry
Would the rules change up or would they still apply
If I played you like a toy?
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Cant be getting mad, but you mad, cant handle that?
Cant be getting mad, but you mad, cant handle that?
Cant be getting mad, but you mad, cant handle that?
Cant be getting mad, but you mad, cant handle that?

If I was always gone, hit the sun getting home
Told you I was with my crew when I knew it wasnt true
If I act like you, walked a mile off in your shoes
Messing with your head again, dose of your own medicine

What if I had a thing on the side, made you cry
Would the rules change up or would they still apply
If I played you like a toy?
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Cant be getting mad, but you mad, cant handle that?
Cant be getting mad, but you mad, cant handle that?
Cant be getting mad, but you mad, cant handle that?
Cant be getting mad, but you mad, cant handle that?

R A go
Heres the clutch

If I paged you, would you like that?
Had friends, would you like that?
With a car, would you like that?
Hell nah, you wouldnt like that, no

What if I made you cry, would they still apply?
What if I, if I played you like a toy?
Sometimes I wish I could act like a boy

Cant handle that?
