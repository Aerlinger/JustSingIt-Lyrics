Into the streets
We're coming down
We never sleep
Never get tired
So urban feels
And suburban lights

Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot at the skylight
And watching it on primetime
Turn up the love now
Listen up now, turn up the love

Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring me back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

OHOHOHOHOOHOH
OHOHOHOHOOHOH
OHOHOHOHOOHOH

We're far from home, it's for the better
What we dream, it's all that matters
We're on our way, united

Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot at the skylight
And watching it on primetime
Turn up the love now
Listen up now, turn up the love

Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring me back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

OHOHOHOHOOHOH
OHOHOHOHOOHOH
OHOHOHOHOOHOH
