It's Britney bitch
I see you
And I just wanna dance with you

Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
You got my display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room but you

We can get down like theres no one around
We keep on rockin, we keep on rockin'
Cameras are flashin while we're dirty dancin
They keep watchin, keep watchin'
Feels like the crowd is sayin

Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more

The center of attention
Even when theyre up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position
If youre on a mission you got my permission

We can get down like theres no one around
We keep on rockin, we keep on rockin', rockin'
Cameras are flashin while we're dirty dancin
They keep watchin, keep watchin'
Feels like the crowd is sayin

Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more

I just can't control myself, oh!
They want more? Well I'll give them more, ow!

Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more

Gimme more, gimme more
Gimme more, gimme more babe
(Danja, Danja, Danja, Danja)
I just want more

Gimme gimme, gimme, gimme gimme
Gimme gimme, gimme, gimme gimme
(Danja, Danja, Danja, Danja)
Gimme gimme, gimme, gimme gimme
Gimme gimme, gimme, gimme gimme

Bet you didnt see this one comin
The incredible Ligo
The legendary Miss Britney Spears
And the unstoppable Danja
Ah, you gonna have to remove me
Cause I aint goin nowhere
