You're lookin' just a little too hard at me
Standin' just a little too close to me
You're sayin' not quite enough to me
You're sippin' just a little too slow for me

No doubt, you play it real cool homie
Got me thinkin' what is it you do for me
Trippin'
(Trippin')
A little more than I should be
So, let yourself go and get right with me

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)

Here I come
Here I come
Here I come
Here I come

Your lips, talkin' 'bout I play too much
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips movin' oh, so slow
(So slow),
Bar tab lookin' like a car note
(Car note)

All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever you want, baby let's ride
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)

So much we've got to say but so little time
And if tonight ain't long enough, don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand, I'll show you why

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
(We can get right)

I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right
We can get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, so we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, tonight
