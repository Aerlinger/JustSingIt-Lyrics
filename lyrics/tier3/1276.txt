When I was young I was invincible
I found myself not thinkin twice
I never thought about no future
Its just a roll of a dice

For the day may come
When youve got somethin to lose
And just when you think
Youre done payin dues

And you say to yourself
Dear God, what have I done?
And hope its not too late
Cause tomorrow may never come

Reach for the sky
Cause tomorrow may never come
Reach for the sky
Cause tomorrow may never come

Yesterday is history
And tomorrows a mystery
But, baby, right now
Its just about you and me

You can run, you can hide
Just like Bonnie and Clyde
Reach for the sky
Aint never gonna die

And I thank the Lord
For the love that I have found
And hold you tight
Cause tomorrow may never come

Reach for the sky
Cause tomorrow may never come
Reach for the sky
Cause tomorrow may never come

So if you please take this moment
Try if you can to make it last
Dont think about no future
And just forget about the past
And make it last

Reach for the sky
Cause tomorrow may never come
(Reach for the sky, I ain't never going down)
Reach for the sky
Cause tomorrow may never come
(Reach for the sky, I ain't never coming down)

Reach for the sky
Cause tomorrow may never come
(Reach for the sky, I ain't never going down)
Reach for the sky
Cause tomorrow may never come
