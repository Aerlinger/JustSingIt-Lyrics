[:chorus:]
My, my, my, delilah
Why? why? why delilah?

I could see that girl was no good for me
But i was lost like a slave that no man could free
At break of day when that man drove away, i was waiting
I cross the street to her house and she opened the door
She stood there laughing
I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more

[:chorus:]
My, my, my delilah
Why? why? why delilah?
