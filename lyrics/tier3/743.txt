Man, man look up at the sky
All the stars man the stars is beautiful tonight
Look at 'em

Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin' from afar reachin' for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh, uh
From one corner to another, uh, uh

Uh yeah, yo, yo,
Some got, hopes and dreams, we got, ways and means
The supreme dream team, always up with the schemes
From hubcaps to sellin' raps, name your theme
My rise to the top, floatin' on this cream

Who the hell wanna stop me, I hated those who doubt me
A million refugees with unlimited warranties
Black Caesar, dating top squeezers
Diplomatic legalese, no time for a Visa

They just begun, I'ma shoot them one by one
Got five sides to me, somethin' like a pentagon
Strike with the forces of King Solomon
Lettin' bygones be bygones and so on and so on

I'ma teach this cat, how to live in the ghetto
Keepin' it retrospective from the get go
Lay low, let my mind shine like a halo
Politic with ghetto senators on the deelow

Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin' from afar reachin' for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh, uh
From one corner to another, uh, uh

One, two and you don't stop, yo my eyes is sore, bein' a senator
Behind closed doors hittin' truth to the sea floor
The rich go North ignore, the tug of war
While the kids are poor, open new and better drug stores

So I became hardcore, couldn't take it no more
I'ma reveal everything, change the law
I find myself, walkin' the streets
Tryin' to find what's really goin' on in the streets

Yeah, yo, yo, yo
Now every dog got his day, needless to say
When the chief away that's when them cats want to play
I told you, mess around you fools like Cassius Clay

Stretch my heater make you do a pas de bourree
Kick your balls like Pele, pick em doin' ballet
Peak like Dante, broader than Broadway
Get applause like a matador, cry yellin', ole
Who the hell wanna save me, from B.K., to Cali, come on

Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin' from afar reachin' for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh, uh
From one corner to another, uh, uh

Yeah, yo, yeah
Just when you thought it was safe in a common place
Showcase your finest is losin fast in the horse race
Two faced, gettin' defaced, out like Scarface
Throw your roll money, let me put on my screw face

Well, I'm paranoid at the things I said
Wonderin' what's the penalty from day to day, I'm hangin' out
Partyin' with girls that never die, you see I was
Pickin' on the small fries, my campaign tellin' lies

Was just spreadin' my love, didn't know my love
Was the one holdin' the gun and the glove
But it's all good as long as it's understand
It's all together now, in the hood

Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin' from afar reachin' for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh, uh
From one corner to another, uh, uh

Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Yeah, all stars, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ghetto superstar, that is what you are
Comin' from afar reachin' for the stars
Run away with me to another place
We can rely on each other, uh, uh
From one corner to another, uh, uh

Sing it baby, sing it baby
To another, ah, ha, ha, ha
Yeah, hay, ah
