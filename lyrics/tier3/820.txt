With so much drama in the L.B.C.
It's kinda hard bein' Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep comin' up with funky ass shit like every single day

May I kick a little something for the G's?
And, make a few ends as I breeze through
Two in the mornin' and the party's still jumpin'
'Cause my momma ain't home

I got bitches in the living room gettin' it on
And, they ain't leavin' 'til six in the mornin'
So what you wanna do? Shit, I got a pocket
Full of rubbers and my homeboys do too

So turn off the lights and close the doors
But, but what? We don't love them ho's, yeah
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Now that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine

Everything is fine when you listenin' to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens, to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street

And get to mackin' to this bitch named Sadie
She used to be the homeboys lady
(Oh, that bitch?)
Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-T's, 'cause you gets none of these

At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
Bitch, I'm just

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Later on that day, my homey
Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J of some bubonic chronic
That made me choke, shit, this ain't no joke

I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah, I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stoppin', I'm still poppin'
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton

To serve me, not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raisin' up off the cot
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you ho's, I'm out the do' and I'll be

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, laid back
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, bitch
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind

Rollin' down the street, smokin' endo
Sippin' on gin and juice, bitch
With my mind on my money
And my money on my mind
