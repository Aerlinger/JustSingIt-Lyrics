Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now

Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da

Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da
Everybody dance now

Give me the music
Give me the music
Everybody

Here is the dome, back with the bass
The jam is live in effect and I don't waste time
On the mike with a dope rhyme
Jump to the rhythm jump jump to the rhythm jump
And I'm here to combine
Beats and lyrics to make your shake your pants
Take a chance, come on and dance
Guys grab a girl, don't wait, make her twirl

It's your world and I'm just a squirrel
Tryin' to get a nut to move your butt
To the dance floor, so you what's up
Hands in the air, come on say yeah
Everybody over here everybody over there
The crowd is live and I pursue this groove
Party people in the house
Move, move
(Let your mind, put me on line)

Come on let's sweat, baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Everybody dance now

Come on let's sweat, baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you

Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody
Everybody dance now

Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da

Da da da da
Da da da da
Da da dum
Everybody dance now

Da da da da
Da da dum dum
Da da dum dum
Everybody dance now

Pause, take a breath and go for yours
On my command now hit the dance floor
It's gonna make you sweat 'til you bleed
Is that dope enough, indeed
I paid the price, I control the dice
I'm more precise, to the point I'm nice
The music takes control, your heart and soul
Unfold, your body is free and a whole

Dance till you can't, dance
Till you can't dance no more
Get on the floor and get raw
Then come back and upside down
Easy now, let me see ya
Move, move
(Let your mind, put me on line)
The music is my life

Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now
Everybody dance now
Everybody

Come on let's sweat, baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you

Sweat baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you

Sweat baby
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you
Sweat, sweat
Let the music take control
Let the rhythm move you

Da da dum dum
Da da dum dum
