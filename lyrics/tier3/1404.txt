Cocaine flame in my bloodstream
Sold my coat when I hit Spokane
Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes
In the early mornin' rain

Lately my hands they don't feel like mine
My eyes been stung with dust and blind
Held you in my arms one time
Lost you just the same

Jolene, I ain't about to go straight, it's too late
I found myself face down in a ditch
Booze in my hair, blood on my lips
A picture of you holding a picture of me
In the pocket of my blue jeans

Still don't know what love means
Still don't know what love means
Jolene, Jolene

Been so long since I seen your face
Felt a part of this human race
I've been living out of this
Here suitcase for way too long

Man needs something he can hold onto
Nine pound hammer or a woman like you
Either one of them things will do

Jolene, I ain't about to go straight, it's too late
I found myself face down in a ditch
Booze in my hair, blood on my lips
A picture of you holding a picture of me
In the pocket of my blue jeans

Still don't know what love means
Still don't know what love means
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
