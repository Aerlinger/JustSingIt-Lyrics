Ooh ooh ooh tomorrow, tomorrow (Tomorrow, tomorrow)
Tomorrow, tomorrow (Tomorrow, tomorrow) Yea
Tomorrow, tomorrow (Tomorrow, tomorrow )Talkin' right now
Tomorrow, tomorrow (Tomorrow, tomorrow) I'm talkin' right now
Tomorrow, tomorrow (Tomorrow, tomorrow) Ain't no such thing as tomorrow
Tomorrow, tomorrow (Tomorrow, tomorrow) The way we livin' today
Tomorrow, tomorrow (Tomorrow, tomorrow) Talkin' right now

(2 Chainz!) Dreads hang on designer everything
Mr. Comme des Garçons, Mr. Alexander Wang
Mr. Chain, pinky ring, flow insane, ho insane
Man, these shoes I got on, these the hardest I've done seen
It look clean when you pour it; I remix it make it dirty
If she got good head and text me I text back and tell her "hurry"
This that category 5 when I walk up in the strip club
Throw it high, make you and George Washington head butt
OG's never fed us, now young n****s fed up
Ballin' so hard, I deserve a and one
Baking soda marketing, I'm getting it ain't I? Obviously.
You a b****, you a ho, that's just my philosophy
And I'm known to kick it like the captain of a soccer team
Billie Jean red leather same color Red Lobster
And she brain wash ya, head doctor
I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching

I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching (Yeah)
I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching (Yeah)
I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching (Tell 'em)
Drop top, head bopping

I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching (Yeah)
I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching (True!)
I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching (Yeah)
Drop top, head bopping

Grams to Grammy's, two guns Yosemite
N****s put their Glock on your a**, f*** that Heather B
Pumping that amphetamine, all this D I'm peddling
I be somewhere settling, somewhere that you have never been
To the top you never been, you might need a respirator
Money on the rise like I'm counting on a elevator
You gon' need a detonator swimming with them barracudas
Put the rocket on that ma'f***a prosecutor
This Armani, this Givenchy, I parachute you
I'm so fly I jumped out the air wearing Gucci (Tell 'em!)
I'm raw, talking California Rolls
Smoking California weed with California hoes (True!)
Sending flicks to my partners in the state pen
I just got some pants made out off snake skin
See them shades you got on call Ray-Bans
And the shade I got on cost eight bands

I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching (Yeah)
I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching (Yeah)
I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching (Tell 'em)
Drop top, head bopping

I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching (Yeah)
I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching (True)
I'm be fresh as hell if the Feds watching (Yeah)
Drop top, head bopping
