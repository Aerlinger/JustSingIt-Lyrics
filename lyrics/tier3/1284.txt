What a great achievement it was
To get a hotel room this late
I bet they charge by the hour here
The kind of place you should bring your own U.V. ray

It's not a big problem with me, love
You don't look that hygienic anyway
I'm only here because
I want to twist the structure of my average day

We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
And know that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
I just hope it's your bones that shatter not mine

We feel nothing, so jump into the fog
And know that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing so jump into the fog

What a great achievement it was
To find someone that shows such little self-restraint
I'm a non-believer but
I believe in these dirty little wicked games

Snakes and ladders abandoned here, love
The climb's too rough just to slide back down again
I'm only here because
I feel today deserves a truly sordid end

We feel nothing so jump into the fog
And know that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing so jump into the fog
I just hope it's your brains that splatter not mine

We feel nothing so jump into the fog
And know that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing so jump into the fog

I've made some bad decisions
I'll admit that freely
It's just that life tastes sweeter
When it's wrapped in debauchery

So drop your map, drop your plans
Drop your five step program
Because there's not an ounce of faith in this leap
It's clear you feel nothing so jump into the fog with me
(Jump in, jump in, jump in)

We feel nothing so jump into the fog
And know that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing so jump into the fog
I just hope it's your brains that splatter not mine

We feel nothing so jump into the fog
And know that we hit the ground upright
We feel nothing so jump into the fog
