	<li><p>She had a shiny little Beemer with the rag top down</p></li>
	<li><p>Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out</p></li>
	<li><p>The dogs were all barkin' and waggin' around</p></li>
	<li><p>And I just laughed and said, “Ya'll get in”</p></li>
	<li><p>She had on a new dress and she curled her hair</p></li>
	<li><p>She was looking too good not to go somewhere</p></li>
	<li><p>Said, "What you want to do, baby, I don't care</p></li>
	<li><p>We can go to the show, we can stay out here"</p></li>
	<li><p>And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor</p></li>
	<li><p>We can go slow or make it go faster</p></li>
	<li><p>Down through the woods and out to the pasture</p></li>
	<li><p>Long as I'm with you, it really don't matter</p></li>
	<li><p>Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to</p></li>
	<li><p>Girl, you know you got me to hold on to</p></li>
	<li><p>We can go to town, but baby, if you'd rather</p></li>
	<li><p>I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor</p></li>
	<li><p>Said we can fire it up and I can show you around</p></li>
	<li><p>Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down</p></li>
	<li><p>When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out</p></li>
	<li><p>We can turn on the lights and head back to the house</p></li>
	<li><p>Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor</p></li>
	<li><p>We can go slow or make it go faster</p></li>
	<li><p>Down through the woods and out to the pasture</p></li>
	<li><p>Long as I'm with you, it really don't matter</p></li>
	<li><p>Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to</p></li>
	<li><p>Girl, you know you got me to hold on to</p></li>
	<li><p>We can go to town, but baby, if you'd rather</p></li>
	<li><p>I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor</p></li>
	<li><p>Just let me dust off the seat</p></li>
	<li><p>Mmm, put your pretty little arms around me</p></li>
	<li><p>Hell, yeah</p></li>
	<li><p>You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to</p></li>
	<li><p>Girl, you know you got me to hold on to</p></li>
	<li><p>We can go to town, but baby, if you'd rather</p></li>
	<li><p>I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor</p></li>
	<li><p>Oh, yeah, yeah</p></li>
	<li><p>We can go to town</p></li>
	<li><p>We can go another round</p></li>
	<li><p>On my big green tractor</p></li>
