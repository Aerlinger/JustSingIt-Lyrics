19 I'll be coming home16 Just to be alone30 'Cause I know you're not there25 And I know you don't care37 I can hardly wait to leave this place0 24 No matter how hard I try22 You're never satisfied18 This is not a home28 I think I'm better off alone0 20 You always disappear21 Even when you're here19 This is not my home28 I think I'm better off alone30 Home, this house is not a home0 25 By the time you come home18 I'm already stoned19 You turn off the tv20 And you scream at me17 I can hardly wait24 'Til you get off my case0 24 No matter how hard I try22 You're never satisfied18 This is not a home28 I think I'm better off alone0 20 You always disappear21 Even when you're here19 This is not my home28 I think I'm better off alone30 Home, this house is not a home0 24 This house is not a home20 I'm better off alone0 11 Songwriters* 57 CARL BROWN / TIMOTHY BRUZON / VIDAR NORHEIM / JAMES WALSH0 12 Published by* 80 Lyrics Â© Royalty Network, EMI Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group0 0 0 * 55 Read more: Three Days Grace - Home Lyrics | MetroLyrics
