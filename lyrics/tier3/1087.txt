Watching the world
Watching them all go insane
Look at them all
Looking them do evil things

So I go out and dance
Party my problems away
Look at me now
Look at me dancing again
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters

but the beat
In a club

I rock club light, come out at Night
shot 'til daylight
Hot models my type
Let's go, take flight
Explode dynamite
Disco blacklight

In a club

Party people rocking hardcore in a club
DJ rock the fucking dancefloor in a club
Hot mamas dancing, all alone, in a club
I just came to rock on out, to escape from the world

Watching the world
Watching them all go insane
Look at them all
Looking them do evil things

So I go out and dance
Party my problems away
Look at me now
Look at me dancing again
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters

but the beat
In a club

Feeling like a star when I walk in the house
DJ spin that record and he burned down the house
Just like MC hammer I'mma turn the motha out
I'mma rock the dancefloor, check me out
I am with all my people, we gon' fuck up the place
I was stressed out, so I had to get away
The world is going mad, I think they gone crazy
So I just gotta break on out

In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters
In a club nothing really matters

Drop the beat
