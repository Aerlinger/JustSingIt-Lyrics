	<li><p>Feeling my way through the darkness</p></li>
	<li><p>Guided by a beatin' heart</p></li>
	<li><p>I can't tell where the journey will end</p></li>
	<li><p>But I know where to start</p></li>
	<li><p>They tell me I'm too young to understand</p></li>
	<li><p>They say I'm caught up in a dream</p></li>
	<li><p>Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes</p></li>
	<li><p>Well that's fine by me</p></li>
	<li><p>So wake me up when it's all over</p></li>
	<li><p>When I'm wiser and I'm older</p></li>
	<li><p>All this time I was finding my self, and I</p></li>
	<li><p>didn't know I was lost</p></li>
	<li><p>So wake me up when it's all over</p></li>
	<li><p>When I'm wiser and I'm older</p></li>
	<li><p>All this time I was finding my self, and I</p></li>
	<li><p>didn't know I was lost</p></li>
	<li><p>I tried carrying the weight of the world</p></li>
	<li><p>But I only have two hands</p></li>
	<li><p>Hope I get the chance to travel the world</p></li>
	<li><p>But I don't have any plans</p></li>
	<li><p>Wish that I could stay forever this young</p></li>
	<li><p>Not afraid to close my eyes</p></li>
	<li><p>Life's a game made for everyone</p></li>
	<li><p>And love is the prize</p></li>
	<li><p>So wake me up when it's all over</p></li>
	<li><p>When I'm wiser and I'm older</p></li>
	<li><p>All this time I was finding my self, and I</p></li>
	<li><p>didn't know I was lost</p></li>
