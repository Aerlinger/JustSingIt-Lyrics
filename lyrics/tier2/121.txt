Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jump inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

Honey got her sexy on steamin'
She givin' hotness a new meanin'
Perfection, mama, you gleamin'
Inception, you got a brother dreamin', dreamin'

Damn, baby, I'm fiendin'
I'm tryna holler at you, I'm screamin'
Let me love you down this evenin'
Love you, love you, ya you know you are my demon

Girl, we could form a team and
I could be the king you could be the queen and
My mind's dirty and it don't need cleanin'
I love you long time so you know the meanin'

Oh, baby, I can't come down
So please come help me out
You got me feelin' high and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jump inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough

I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough

Honey got me runnin' like I'm Flo Jo
Signs her name on my heart with an XO
Love so sweet, got me vexed though
I wanna wish it right back like presto, yes

Meantime I wait for the next time
She come around 'for I toast to the best time
We all the while back and forth on the text line
She got me fishin' for her love, I confess I'm

Somethin' 'bout her smile and that combo
Got me high and I ain't comin' down, yo
My heart's pumpin' out louder than electro
She got me feelin' like Mr. Roboto

Oh, baby, I can't come down
So please come help me out
You got me feelin' high and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough

Boy, I think about it every night and day
I'm addicted, wanna jump inside your love
I wouldn't wanna have it any other way
I'm addicted and I just can't get enough

Got stuck in your bed rock
Caught up in your love shock
Knocked out by your cold shot
I'm stuck in your head like

Can't stop, won't quit
Makin' me fiend, give it to me
I want it all, know what I mean
Your love is a dose of ecstasy

Addicted, I can't get away from you
Afflicted, I need it, I'm missin'
I want your lovin' right next to me
And I can't erase you out of my memory
I just can't
