[:chorus:]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
When i go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her

And i go back to
Black, black, black, black
Black, black, black
I go back to
I go back to

[:chorus:]
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
And i go back to
We only said goodbye with words
I died a hundred times
You go back to her
