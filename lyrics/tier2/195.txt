I gotta feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling, woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling, woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up
Go out and smash it like oh my God
Jump off that sofa, let's get, get off

I know that we'll have a ball
If we get down and go out and just lose it all
I feel stressed out, I wanna let it go
Let's go way out spaced out and losing all control

Fill up my cup, mazel tov
Look at her dancing, just take it off
Let's paint the town, we'll shut it down
Let's burn the roof, and then we'll do it again

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
And do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

'Cause I gotta feeling, woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling, woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

Tonight's the night
(Hey!)
Let's live it up
(Let's live it up)
I got my money
(My pay)
Let's spend it up
(Let's spend it up)

Go out and smash it
(Smash it)
Like oh my God
(Like oh my God)
Jump off that sofa
(Come on!)
Let's get, get off

Fill up my cup
(Drink)
Mazel tov
(Le heim)
Look at her dancing
(Move it, move it)
Just take it off

Let's paint the town
(Paint the town)
We'll shut it down
(Let's shut it down)
Let's burn the roof
And then we'll do it again

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, let's do it
And do it and do it, let's live it up
And do it and do it and do it, do it, do it
Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it, do it, do it, do it

Here we come, here we go, we gotta rock
(Rock rock rock rock rock)
Easy come, easy go, now we on top
(Top top top top top)
Feel the shot, body rock, rock it, don't stop
(Stop stop stop stop stop)
Round and round, up and down, around the clock
(Rock rock rock rock rock)

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
(Do it!)
Friday, Saturday, Saturday to Sunday
(Do it!)
Get, get, get, get, get with us, you know what we say, say
Party every day, p-p-p-party every day

And I'm feelin', woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

I gotta feeling, woohoo, that tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
Woohoo
