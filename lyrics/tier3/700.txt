Shakedown 1979
Cool kids never have the time
On a live wire right up off the street
You and I should meet

June bug skipping like a stone
With the headlights pointed at the dawn
We were sure we'd never see an end to it all

And I don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

Double cross the vacant and the bored
They're not sure just what we have in the store
Morphine city slippin' dues down to see

We don't even care as restless as we are
We feel the pull in the land of a thousand guilts
And poured cement, lamented and assured
To the lights and towns below

Faster than the speed of sound
Faster than we thought we'd go
Beneath the sound of hope

Justine never knew the rules
Hung down with the freaks and the ghouls
No apologies ever need be made
I know you better than you fake it to see

That we don't even care to shake these zipper blues
And we don't know just where our bones will rest
To dust I guess forgotten and absorbed
Into the earth below

The street heats the urgency of now
As you see there's no one around
