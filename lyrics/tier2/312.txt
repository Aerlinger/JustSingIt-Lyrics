Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music

It's gettin' late, I'm making my way over to my favorite place
I gotta get my body moving, shake the stress away
I wasn't looking for nobody when you looked my way
Possible candidate, yeah

Who knew that you'd be up here, lookin' like you do
You're making stayin' over here impossible
Baby, I must say, your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't

Do you know what you started? I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, actin' naughty
Your hands around my waist, just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest and now we're face to face

I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music
DJ, let it play, I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music

I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music
DJ, let it play, I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music

Baby, are you ready 'cause it's getting close?
Don't you feel the passion, ready to explode?
What goes on between us, no one has to know
This is a private show, oh

Do you know what you started? I just came here to party
But now we're rockin' on the dance floor, acting naughty
Your hands around my waist, just let the music play
We're hand in hand, chest to chest and now we're face to face

I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music
DJ, let it play, I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music

I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music
DJ, let it play, I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music

Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music

I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music
DJ, let it play, I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the music

I wanna take you away, let's escape into the music
DJ, let it play, I just can't refuse it, like the way you do this
Keep on rockin' to it, please don't stop the
Please don't stop the, please don't stop the music

Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
Please don't stop the music
