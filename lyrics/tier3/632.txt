If it's cool
We can do a little sumthin' sumthin'
Let me groove with you
So we can kick a little sumthin' sumthin'

Even though she pays me no attention
All I wanna show is my affection
Lose myself inside her ebony
But she ain't even checkin' me, oh yea

If it's cool
We can do a little sumthin' sumthin'
Let me groove with you
So we can kick a little sumthin' sumthin'

Honeydosugachocolate dumplin' yeah
Sista with a certain sumthin' sumthin'
Flavor with a cocoa kinda flow
Baby, baby act like you know

So if it's cool, I wanna rock with you
Slip you my mellow smooth
Rock you until we're blue
Only, only if it's cool

If it's cool
We can do a little sumthin' sumthin'
Let me groove with you
So we can kick a little sumthin' sumthin'

So if it's cool, I wanna rock with you
Slip you my mellow smooth
Rock you until we're blue
Only, only if it's cool

If it's cool
We can do a little sumthin' sumthin'
Let me groove with you
So we can kick a little sumthin' sumthin'

If it's cool
We can do a little sumthin' sumthin'
Let me groove with you
So we can kick a little sumthin' sumthin'
