Broke dick dog
My head slung low
Tail knocked in the dirt
Time and time
Of being told
Trash is all Im worth

When I was just a young boy
Had to take a little grief
Now that Im much older
Dont put your shit on me

Grab it and shake
Reach down scrape it
You just got to

Scream and shout
Let that mother out
You just gotta say hey
Primal scream and shout
Ooh tear it out
You just gotta say

Janou said
"The Meters are red
Gonna blow a neurotic fuse"
Show a little
A little pain
Unlock a lotta truth

When daddy was a young man
His home was livin hell
Mama tried to be so perfect
Now her minds a padded cell, ya

Grab it and shake
Reach down scrape it
You just got to

Scream and shout
Tear that circuit down
You just gotta say hey, alright
Primal scream and shout
Strike that tower down
You just gotta say, kick it

Hey man, get out of my face
I deal with my problems at my own pace
With your screwed-down, anti-human views
Deal with the pressures by playing the blues
If you wanna live life on your own terms
You gotta be willing to crash and burn

Primal scream and shout
Tear that circuit down
You just gotta say, hey
Primal scream and shout
Strike that tower down
You just gotta say kick it

Scream shout come on, come on, come on
Scream shout
