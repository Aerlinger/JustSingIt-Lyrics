I could watch you for a lifetime,
you're my favourite movie,
a thousand endings,
you mean everything to me;
I never know what's coming,
forever facinating,
hope you don't stop running,
to make us always be waiting....

You are, a cinema,
I could watch you forever,
Action, thriller,
I could watch you forever,
You are, a cinema,
A Hollywood treasure,
Love you, just the way you are,
A cinema, a cinema

(Chorus)

Stars spell out your name,
Like in a science-fiction drama,
Romance growing,
Like a flower in the summer,
You always keep me guessing,
Forever my wonder,
I hope you start undressing,
All my dreams (unknown)

You are, a cinema,
I could watch you forever,
Action, thriller,
I could watch you forever,
You are, a cinema,
A Hollywood treasure,
Love you, just the way you are,
A cinema, a cinema[x2]
