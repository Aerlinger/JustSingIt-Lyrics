	<li><p>That you found a girl and you're married now</p></li>
	<li><p>I heard that your dreams came true</p></li>
	<li><p>Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you</p></li>
	<li><p>Old friend, why are you so shy?</p></li>
	<li><p>Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light</p></li>
	<li><p>I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited</p></li>
	<li><p>But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it</p></li>

	<li><p>That for me, it isn't over</p></li>
	<li><p>Never mind, I'll find someone like you</p></li>
	<li><p>I wish nothing but the best for you, too</p></li>
	<li><p>Don't forget me, I beg</p></li>

	<li><p>In a summer haze</p></li>

	<li><p>No worries or cares</p></li>
	<li><p>Regrets and mistakes</p></li>
	<li><p>They are memories made</p></li>
	<li><p>Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?</p></li>
