* 41 Gonna put the the world away for a minute26 Pretend I don't live in it33 Sunshine gonna wash my blues away0 28 Had sweet love but I lost it33 She got too close so I fought her* 56 Now I'm lost in the world trying to find me a better way0 * 46 Wishing I was knee deep in the water somewhere* 46 Got the blue sky breeze and it don't seem fair* 56 Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair33 Sunrise there's a fire in the sky19 Never been so happy18 Never felt so high* 57 And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise0 37 Wrote a note said be back in a minute36 Bought a boat and I sailed off in it40 Don't think anybody gonna miss me anyway0 28 Mind on a permanent vacation31 The ocean is my only medication* 45 Wishing my condition ain't ever gonna go away0 * 45 Cause now im knee deep in the water somewhere* 52 Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair* 56 Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair33 Sunrise there's a fire in the sky19 Never been so happy18 Never felt so high* 57 And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise0 36 This champagne shore washing over me* 47 It's a sweet sweet life living by the salty sea34 One day you could be as lost as me23 Change you're geography18 Maybe you might be0 32 Knee deep in the water somewhere* 52 Got the blue sky breeze blowing wind through my hair* 56 Only worry in the world is the tide gonna reach my chair33 Sunrise there's a fire in the sky19 Never been so happy18 Never felt so high* 57 And I think I might have found me my own kind of paradise0 30 Come on in the water it's nice28 Find yourself a little slice23 Grab a backpack of lies28 You never know until you try22 When you lose yourself28 You find the key to paradise0 0 0 * 58 Read more: Zac Brown Band - Knee Deep Lyrics | MetroLyrics
