You say that I'm messing with your head (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All 'cause I was making out with your friend (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Love hurts whether it's right or wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't stop 'cause I'm having too much fun (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You're on your knees
Begging please
Stay with me
But honestly I just need to be a little crazy

All my life I've been good but now
ooooh
I'm thinking, what the @#$%?
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good but now
Whoa, what the @#$%?

What
What
What
What the @#$%?

So what if I go out on a million dates? (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
You never call or listen to me anyway (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I rather rage than sit around and wait all day (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Don't get me wrong, I just need some time to play (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

You're on your knees
Begging please
Stay with me
But honestly I just need to be a little crazy

All my life I've been good but now
ooooh
I'm thinking, what the @#$%?
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good but now
Whoa, what the @#$%?

You say that I'm messing with your head
Boy, I like messing in your bed
Yeah, I am messing with your head
When I'm messing with you in bed

All my life I've been good but now
ooooh
I'm thinking, what the @#$%?
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

All my life I've been good but now
ooooh
I'm thinking, what the @#$%?
All I want is to mess around
And I don't really care about

If you love me, if you hate me
You can't save me, baby, baby
All my life I've been good but now
Whoa, what the @#$%?

You say that I'm messing with your head
boy i like messing in ur bed
teah i'm messing with ur hed when
i'm messing with u in bed
la,la,la,la,la,la la ,la
la,la,la,la,la,la,la,la
