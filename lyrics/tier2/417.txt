Rob the jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill
Dirty, R&B, add da whole top diamond and the bottom row's gold
Yo, we 'bout to start a epidemic wit dis one
Y'all know what dis is so so def

Got thirty down at the bottom, thirty mo at the top
All invisible set in little ice cube blocks
If I could call it a drink, call it a smile on da rocks
If I could call out a price, let's say, I call out a lot
I got like platinum and white gold, traditional gold
I'm changin' grillz everyday, like Jay change clothes

I might be grilled out nicely in my white tee
On South beach in my wife beat, VV and studded
You can tell when they cut it, ya, see my grandmama hate it
But my lil' mama love it 'cuz when I open up ya mouth
Ya grill gleamin', say what? Eyes stay low from da cheifin'

I got a grill,l I call penny candy, you know what that means?
It look like now and laters, gum drops, jelly beans
I wouldn't leave it for nothin' only a crazy man would
So if you catch me in ya city, somewhere out in ya hood just say

Smile fo me daddy, what you lookin' at?
Let me see ya grill, let you see my, what?
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Rob da jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill

Smile fo me daddy, what you lookin' at?
I want to see your grill, you wanna see my, what?
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Had a whole top diamonds and da bottom row's gold

What it do, baby? It's da ice man Paul Wall
I got my mouth lookin' somethin' like a disco ball
I got da diamonds and da ice all hand set
I might cause a cold front if I take a deep breath
My teeth gleaming like I'm chewin' on aluminum foil

Smilin' showin' off my diamonds sippin' on some Pinot Noir
I put my money where my mouth is and bought a grill
Twenty carrots thirty stacks let 'em know I'm so fo real
My motivation is from thirty pointers VVS, the furniture
My mouth piece simply symbolize success

I got da wrist wear and neck wear dats captivatin'
But it's my smile dat's got these on-lookers spectatin'
My mouth piece simply certified a total package
Open up my mouth and you see mo carrots than a salad
My teeth are mind blowin' givin' everybody chillz
Call me George Foreman 'cuz I'm sellin' everybody grillz

Smile fo me daddy, what you lookin' at?
Let me see ya grill, let you see my, what?
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Rob da jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill

Smile fo me daddy, what you lookin' at?
I want to see your grill, you wanna see my, what?
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Had a whole top diamonds and da bottom row's gold

Gipp got dem yellows, got dem purples, got dem reds
Lights gon' hit ya and make you woozie in ya head
You can catch me in my two short drop, mouth got colors
Like a fruit loop box, dis what it do when da lou
Ice grill country grammar, where da hustlas move bricks
And da gangsta's bang hamma's, where I got 'em

You can spot them on da top in da bottom
Gotta bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham
I ain't dissin' no body but let's bring it to da lite
Gipp was da first wit my mouth bright white
Yeah, deez hos can't focus 'cuz they eyesight blurry

Tippin' on some 4's you can see my mouth jewelry
I got fo different sets, it's a fabulous thang
One white, one yellow like fabulous chain
And da otha set is same got my name in da mold
Had a whole top diamonds and da bottom Row's gold

Smile fo me daddy, what you lookin' at?
Let me see ya grill, let you see my, what?
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Rob da jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill

Smile fo me daddy, what you lookin' at?
I want to see your grill, you wanna see my, what?
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Had a whole top diamonds and da bottom row's gold

Boy how you get grill that way and how much did you pay?
Every time I see you, tha first thing I'm gon' say hey

Smile fo me daddy, what you lookin' at?
Let me see ya grill, let you see my, what?
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Rob da jewelry store and tell 'em make me a grill

Smile fo me daddy, what you lookin' at?
I want to see your grill, you wanna see my, what?
Ya, ya grill ya, ya, ya grill
Had a whole top diamonds and da bottom row's gold
