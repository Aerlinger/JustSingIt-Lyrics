39 Where is the moment we needed the most?* 44 You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost* 41 They tell me your blue skies fade to grey37 They tell me your passion's gone away31 And I don't need no carryin' on0 * 43 You stand in the line just to hit a new low* 43 You're faking a smile with the coffee to go* 42 They tell me your life's been way off line35 You're falling to pieces every time31 And I don't need no carryin' on0 * 47 Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down* 42 You sing a sad song just to turn it around* 45 You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie* 41 You work on a smile and you go for a ride0 39 You had a bad day, the camera don't lie* 49 You're coming back down and you really don't mind17 You had a bad day17 You had a bad day0 32 Well you need a blue sky holiday39 The point is they laugh at what you say31 And I don't need no carryin' on0 * 41 You had a bad day, you're taking one down* 42 You sing a sad song just to turn it around* 45 You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie* 41 You work on a smile and you go for a ride0 39 You had a bad day, the camera don't lie* 49 You're coming back down and you really don't mind17 You had a bad day17 Mmm, on a holiday0 38 Sometimes the system goes on the blink38 And the whole thing it turns out wrong39 You might not make it back and you know37 That you could be well oh that strong17 And I'm not wrong0 * 51 So where was the passion when you need it the most?12 Oh you and I* 44 You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost0 * 47 Cause you had a bad day, you're taking one down* 42 You sing a sad song just to turn it around* 45 You say you don't know, you tell me don't lie* 41 You work on a smile and you go for a ride0 * 43 You had a bad day, you see what you're like37 And how does it feel a one more time?17 You had a bad day17 You had a bad day0 13 Had a bad day13 Had a bad day13 Had a bad day0 11 Songwriters6 POWTER0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 55 Read more: Daniel Powter - Bad Day Lyrics | MetroLyrics
