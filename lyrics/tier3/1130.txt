Never i go away
It's the anthemic
I go for the music
It's the fall i do
Never go again i do
Keep decision and i save to stay

Chorus:
I do anthemic (the anthemic)
It's the work (Anthemic)
All the anthemics, it's the work
A anthemic feel (Anthemic)
It's a new anthemic (The anthemic)
All the anthemics, it's the work

I'm another on the anthemic
I don't ever look again
To beautiful anthemic i do
Told it to save it today
It's the thrills nowhere go
Keep decision and i save to stay

Chorus 3x:
I do anthemic (the anthemic)
It's the work (Anthemic)
All the anthemics, it's the work
A anthemic feel (Anthemic)
It's a new anthemic (The anthemic)
All the anthemics, it's the work
