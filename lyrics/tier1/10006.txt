Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

Drift away like Tom Sawyer
Ride a raft with ol' Huck Finn
Take a nap like Rip Van Winkle
Daze dreamin' again

Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway

Swim across the river
Just to prove that I'm a man
Spend the day bein' lazy
Just bein' nature's friend

Climb a long tall hickery
Bend it over, "Skinnin' cats"
Playin' baseball with chert rocks
Usin' sawmill slabs for bats

Play some back-home
Come-on music that comes from the heart
Play something with lots of feelin'
'Cause that's where music has to start

Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then I'll float on down the river
To a Cajun hideaway, hey hey

Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play me mountain music
Oh, play, yeah yeah
