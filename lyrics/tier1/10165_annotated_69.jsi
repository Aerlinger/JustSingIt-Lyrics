* 60 It kills me not to know this but I've all but just forgotten* 65 What the color of her eyes were and her scars or how she got them* 64 As the telling signs of age rain down, a single tear is dropping* 66 Through the valleys of an aging face that this world has forgotten0 * 55 There is no reconciliation that will put me in my place* 69 And there is no time like the present to drink these draining seconds* 67 But seldom do these words ring true when I'm constantly failing you* 62 Like walls that we just can't break through until we disappear0 * 57 So tell me now if this ain't love then how do we get out?19 'Cause I don't know0 * 41 That's when she said I don't hate you but* 66 I just want to save you while there's still something left to save38 That's when I told her I love you girl* 68 But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh0 * 44 And the day pressed on like crushing weights28 For no man does it ever wait* 58 Like memories of dying days that deafen us like hurricanes* 69 Bathed in flames we held the brand, uncurled the fingers in your hand* 56 Pressed into the flesh like sand, now do you understand?0 * 57 So tell me now if this ain't love then how do we get out?19 'Cause I don't know0 * 41 That's when she said I don't hate you but* 66 I just want to save you while there's still something left to save38 That's when I told her I love you girl* 68 But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh0 * 52 One thousand miles away, there's nothing left to say34 But so much left that I don't know* 51 We never had a choice, this world is too much noise* 47 It takes me under, it takes me under once again0 16 I don't hate you20 I don't hate you, no0 * 57 So tell me now if this ain't love then how do we get out?19 'Cause I don't know0 * 41 That's when she said I don't hate you but* 66 I just want to save you while there's still something left to save38 That's when I told her I love you girl* 68 But I'm not the answer for the questions that you still have, oh, oh0 16 I don't hate you24 I don't hate you, oh, oh16 I don't hate you28 I don't hate you, no, oh, oh0 11 Songwriters* 68 BLAIR, ZACH / PRINCIPE, JOSEPH / MCILRATH, TIMOTHY / BARNES, BRANDON0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 53 Read more: Rise Against - Savior Lyrics | MetroLyrics
