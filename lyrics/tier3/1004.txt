Meet me in the evening, where the river is low
Meet me on the waters of the Ohio
No lines, no lines, the river is a river, not a line
My blood is the water and it's darker and deeper than time

If the hounds are howling, then you cannot hide
My friend, I will meet you on the other side
No lines, no lines, the river is a river, not a line
My love is the water and it's stronger and deeper than time

Meet me 'neath the moon, under the singing tree
If you are the first, stay there and wait for me
If no one comes by morning and the sun is a-rising red
If no one comes by morning, please forgive me, my friend
For I am dead
