She says she likes my watch, but she wants Steve's AP
And she stay up all hours watching QVC
She said she loves my songs, she bought my MP3
And so I put her number in my Bold BB

I got a black BM, she got a white TT
She wanna see what's hiding in my CK briefs
I tell her, wear suspenders and some PVC
And then I'll film it all up on my JVC

Scene one, everybody get in your positions
Pay attention and listen
We're tryna get this all in one take
So let's try and make that happen
Take one, action

She pose for FHM, she like my Black LV
We spinning LPR, up on my APC
I'm in my PRPS and my Nike SBs
Raving with SHM, London to NYC

I got my visa and my Visa, a diva and her dealer
Bitch, I'm up on the guest list with the Swedish House Mafia
You can find me on a table full of vodka and tequila
Surrounded by some bunnies and it ain't fucking Easter

I wake up in the morning with a mild case of amnesia
With a girl that like a girl like Lindsey Lo and Queen Latifah
If you niggas are balling, then boy I must be FIFA
And that's standard procedure from Miami 2 Ibiza

Yeah
From Miami 2 Ibiza
Yeah
From Miami 2 Ibiza

Songwriters
Okogwu, Patrick Junior Chukwuemeka / Angello, Steve / Hedfors, Axel / Ingrosso, Sebastian
