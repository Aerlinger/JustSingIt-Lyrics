* 50 Wandering the streets in a world underneath it all* 65 Nothing seems to be, nothing tastes as sweet as what I can't have0 * 69 Like you and the way that you're twisting your hair round your finger* 56 Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you what I feel about you0 * 52 Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have30 And cannon ball into the water* 49 I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have14 For you I will14 For you I will0 * 61 Forgive me if I st-stutter from all of the clutter in my head* 56 Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes like a water bed0 * 65 Do I seem familiar? I've crossed you in hallways a thousand times* 66 No more camouflage, I want to be exposed and not be afraid to fall0 * 52 Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have30 And cannon ball into the water* 49 I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have14 For you I will0 35 You always want what you can't have19 But I've got to try* 49 I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have14 For you I will14 For you I will14 For you I will7 For you0 * 69 If I could dim the lights in the mall and create a mood, yeah I would* 52 Shout out your name so it echoes in every room, yeah0 18 That's what I'd do18 That's what I'd do27 To get through to you, yeah0 * 52 Oh I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have30 And cannon ball into the water* 49 I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have14 For you I will0 35 You always want what you can't have19 But I've got to try* 49 I'm gonna muster every ounce of confidence I have14 For you I will14 For you I will14 For you I will14 For you I will0 11 Songwriters27 MANN, BILLY / GEIGER, TEDDY0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 74 Read more: Teddy Geiger - For You I Will (confidence) Lyrics | MetroLyrics
