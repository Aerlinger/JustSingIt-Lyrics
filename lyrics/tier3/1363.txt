Take me to your best friend's house
Goin' round this roundabout
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now
Oh yeah

Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't break

Take me to your best friend's house
Marmelade we're making out
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now

Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't break

One, two, three, four
Don't leave me tongue tied
Let's stay up all night
I'll get real high
Slumber party; pillow fight
My eyes on your eyes
Like Peter Pan up in the sky
My best friend's house tonight
Let's bump the beats till beddy-bye

Don't take me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't take me tongue tied
Don't kiss me goodnight
Don't...

Take me to your best friend's house
Goin' round this roundabout
Oh yeah
Take me to your best friend's house
I loved you then and I love you now

Don't leave me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't leave me tongue tied
Don't...
Don't leave me tongue tied
Don't wave no goodbye
Don't leave me tongue tied
Don't...
