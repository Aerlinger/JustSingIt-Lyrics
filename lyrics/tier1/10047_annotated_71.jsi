38 Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight36 It must have been something you said32 I just died in your arms tonight0 40 I keep looking for something I can't get36 Broken hearts, they're all around me* 48 And I don't see an easier way to get out of this35 Her diary sits by the bedside table* 48 The curtains are closed, the cat's in the cradle* 61 Who would have thought that a boy like me could come to this?0 38 Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight36 It must have been something you said32 I just died in your arms tonight38 Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight35 It must have been some kind of kiss25 I should have walked away25 I should have walked away0 * 46 Is there any just cause for feeling like this?35 On the surface I'm a name on a list* 43 I try to be discreet but then blow it again* 41 I've lost and found it's my final mistake* 43 She's loving by proxy, no give and all take* 56 'Cause I've been thrilled to fantasy, one too many times0 38 Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight36 It must have been something you said32 I just died in your arms tonight38 Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight35 It must have been some kind of kiss25 I should have walked away25 I should have walked away0 * 41 It was a long hot night, she made it easy22 She made it feel right38 But now it's over, the moment has gone* 50 I followed my hands to my head, I know I was wrong0 38 Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight36 It must have been something you said32 I just died in your arms tonight38 Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight35 It must have been some kind of kiss25 I should have walked away25 I should have walked away0 11 Songwriters14 EEDE, NICHOLAS0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 71 Read more: Cutting Crew - I Just Died In Your Arms Lyrics | MetroLyrics
