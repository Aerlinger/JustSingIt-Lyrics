Where's my sock?
Where's my other shoe?
I didn't know what time it was
When I came to

The only light in here
Is my flickering TV
Watching back at me
Oh, my love is here to stay

Saints alive
And all the saints be praised
I see them all around me now
They've been called and raised

Their jaws gone slack
Their yellow nails long and curling back
To scratch the phantom of ache
Of our lost days
Oh, my love is here to stay

I came home this morning
I was dead on my feet
Drunk on the victory
Of my own defeat

Now I'm reeling on the ceiling
But what yard bird law is this
When a heart in chains is what remains
The prelude to a kiss?

God is in the details
Of the smoke in the air
The devil, he's a pauper prince
Nesting in your hair

The things we put together
The world will ear a part
But I've beat them to the start
Alone the way
Oh, my love is here to stay
