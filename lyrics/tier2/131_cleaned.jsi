You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Now you in a corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, for a second you were here
Now you over there, it's hard not to stare the way you moving
Your body, like you never had a love, never had a love

When you is just a young one your looks but so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure

You never credit yourself so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this @#$% corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See, you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Now you in a corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love, for a second you were here
Now you over there, it's hard not to stare the way you moving
Your body, like you never had a love, never had a love

You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions
You the one here talking to me, you don't wanna listen

But I admire your poppin' bottles and pimpin'
Just as much you admire my bartending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad, nobody else trippin'
You seen a lot of crooks and crooks still crook

See, you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever

Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

See I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You're beautiful, you're beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You're far from the usual, far from the usual

See, you had a lot of crooks
Tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

See, you had a lot of moments
That didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

See, you had a lot of crooks
Tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't never figure out
How to love, how to love

See, you had a lot of moments
That didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
