	<li><p>This old man and me</p></li>
	<li><p>Were at the bar and we</p></li>
	<li><p>Were havin' us some beers and</p></li>
	<li><p>Swappin' I don't cares</p></li>
	<li><p>Talkin' politics</p></li>
	<li><p>Blonde and redhead chicks</p></li>
	<li><p>Old dogs and new tricks and</p></li>
	<li><p>Habits we ain't kicked</p></li>
	<li><p>We talked about Gods grace</p></li>
	<li><p>And all the hell we raised</p></li>
	<li><p>Then I heard the old man say,</p></li>
	<li><p>“God is great, beer is good and People Are Crazy”</p></li>
	<li><p>He said "I fought two wars,</p></li>
	<li><p>Been married and divorced"</p></li>
	<li><p>What brings you to Ohio?</p></li>
	<li><p>He said "Damn if I know"</p></li>
	<li><p>We talked an hour or two</p></li>
	<li><p>About every girl we knew</p></li>
	<li><p>What all we put ‘em through</p></li>
	<li><p>Like two old boys will do</p></li>
	<li><p>We pondered life and death</p></li>
	<li><p>He light a cigarette</p></li>
	<li><p>He said "These damn things will kill me yet,</p></li>
	<li><p>But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy"</p></li>
	<li><p>Last call its 2:00am</p></li>
	<li><p>I said goodbye to him</p></li>
	<li><p>I never talked to him again</p></li>
	<li><p>Then one sunny day</p></li>
	<li><p>I saw the old man's face</p></li>
	<li><p>Front page Obituary</p></li>
	<li><p>He was a millionaire he</p></li>
	<li><p>He left his fortune to</p></li>
	<li><p>Some guy he barely knew</p></li>
	<li><p>His kids were mad as hell</p></li>
	<li><p>Huh but me, I'm doing well</p></li>
	<li><p>And I drop by today</p></li>
	<li><p>To just say thanks and pray</p></li>
	<li><p>And I left a six-pack right there on his grave</p></li>
	<li><p>And I said God is great, beer is good and people are crazy</p></li>
	<li><p>God is great, beer is good and people are crazy</p></li>
	<li><p>God is great, beer is good and people are crazy</p></li>
