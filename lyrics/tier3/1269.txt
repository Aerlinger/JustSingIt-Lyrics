Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio

Oh, it should've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
Well, you told me about nowhere
Well, it sounds like someplace I'd like to go

Oh, it could've been, should've been worse than you would ever know
Well, the windshield was broken but I love the fresh air you know
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)

Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know, oh
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Oh, we talked about nothing which was more than I wanted you to know
Now here we go

Oh, it would've been, could've been worse than it had even gone
Well, the car was on blocks, but I was already where I want
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)

Why should we ever even ever really even get to know?
(It was impossible, we ran it good, we ran it good)
Oh, if the world don't like us it'll shake us just like we were a cold
Now here we go

Well we scheme and we scheme but we always blow it
We've yet to crash, but we still might as well enjoy it
Standing at a light switch to each east and west horizon
Every dawn when you're surprising, and the evening was consoling
Saying, "See it wasn't quite as bad as"

Well, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
I was patiently erasing and recording the wrong episodes
After you had proved my point wrong
It wasn't like I'd let it go, oh oh oh, oh oh oh
I just wanted to catch the last laugh of this show

Yeah, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
Oh, the dashboard melted, but we still have the radio
(The dashboard melted, but we ran it good, we ran it good)

Hard-wired to conceive, so much we'd have to stow it
Even needs have needs, tiny giants made of tinier giants
Don't wear eyelids so I don't miss the last laugh of this show
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)

Well, we could've been, should've been worse than you would ever know
(The dashboard melted but we still have the radio)
Well, you told me about nowhere
Well, it sounds like someplace I'd like to go
Now here we go

Well we schemed and we scheme but we always blow it
We've yet to crash, but we still might as well enjoy it
Standing at a light switch to each east and west horizon
Every dawn when you're surprising, and the evening was consoling
Saying, "See it wasn't quite as bad as"

Oh, it would've been, could've been worse than you would ever know
