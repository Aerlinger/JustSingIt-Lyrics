I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Shawty, I roll up
I roll up, I roll up

It's your anniversary isn't it?
And your man ain't acting right
So you packing your Damier luggage up
Calling my cell phone, trying to catch a flight

You know one thing straight
I'll be there girl whenever you call me
When you at home, that's your man
Soon as you land you say it's all me

'Cause shit ain't all G with him, no more
You ain't entertained
Since I meet you a couple months ago
You ain't been the same

Not saying I'm the richest man alive
But I'm in the game
As long as you keep it 100
I'ma spend this change

Whenever you need me, whenever you want me
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie

I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front
You know if I ball then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up

I try to stay out your business
But on the real you're so obvious
And if you keep fitting me in your plans and fucking up
Your man's gonna catch onto us

That white sand surrounding us
He be handcuffing, he should work for them officers
If you rolling, I got a spot where I can put you on this medical
And send you home, doctored up

You wanna ride with me 'cause you say that he boring
Wake up you rolling weed, cooking eggs in the morning
Ain't scared to spend this money, I know I'll make more of it
First you was in the sky, now you say you in orbit

Whenever you need me, whenever want me
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie

I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front
You know if I ball then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up

No matter where I am, no matter where you are
I'll be there when it's over, baby
'Cause I was there from the start
Don't matter if I'm near, don't matter if you're far
All you do is pick the phone up lady
And I'll be there when you call

Whenever you need me, whenever want me
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie

I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front
You know if I ball then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up

Whenever you need me, whenever want me
You know you can call me, I'll be there shortly
Don't care what your friends say, 'cause they don't know me
I can be your best friend and you be my homie

I ain't gonna flex, I'm not gonna front
You know if I ball then we all gon' stunt
Send her my way, she ain't gotta hold up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up, I roll up, I roll up
Whenever you call, baby, I roll up
I roll up, I roll up, I roll up, whenever you call, baby, I roll up
