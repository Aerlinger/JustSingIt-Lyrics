20 I walk a lonely road35 The only one that I have ever known24 Don't know where it goes36 But it's home to me and I walk alone0 24 I walk this empty street33 On the Boulevard of broken dreams21 Where the city sleeps37 And I'm the only one and I walk alone0 12 I walk alone12 I walk alone0 12 I walk alone8 I walk a0 * 45 My shadow's the only one that walks beside me* 48 My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating* 47 Sometimes I wish some one up there will find me22 Till then I walk alone0 27 Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah19 Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah0 25 I'm walking down the line36 That divides me somewhere in my mind30 On the border line of the edge22 And where I walk alone0 22 Read between the lines* 41 What's @#$% up and everything's all right* 44 Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive16 And I walk alone0 12 I walk alone12 I walk alone0 12 I walk alone8 I walk a0 * 45 My shadow's the only one that walks beside me* 48 My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating* 47 Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me22 Till then I walk alone0 27 Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah12 Ah-ah, ah-ah0 12 I walk alone8 I walk a0 24 I walk this empty street33 On the Boulevard of broken dreams21 Where the city sleeps33 And I'm the only one and I walk a0 * 45 My shadow's the only one that walks beside me* 48 My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating* 47 Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me22 Till then I walk alone0 11 Songwriters* 66 ARMSTRONG, BILLIE JOE/WRIGHT III, FRANK EDWIN/PRITCHARD, MIKE RYAN0 12 Published by36 Lyrics Â© Warner/Chappell Music, Inc.0 0 0 * 70 Read more: Green Day - Boulevard Of Broken Dreams Lyrics | MetroLyrics
