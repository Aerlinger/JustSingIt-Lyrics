I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gonna rush the stroll

So she can get a sexual eruption
So I can get a sexual eruption
So we can get a sexual eruption
Sexual eruption

She might be with him
But she's thinkin' 'bout me, me, me
We don't go to the mall
We don't go out to eat, eat, eat

All that we ever do
Is play in the sheets, sheets, sheets
Smoke us a cigarette
And go back to sleep, sleep, sleep

'Cause we done got a
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption

I'm gonna take my time
She gon' get hers before I
I'm gonna take it slow
I'm not gonna rush the stroll

If you don't know by now
Doggy Dogg is a freak, freak, freak
I keep a bad *** with me
Seven days out the week, week, week

And all that we ever do
Is play in the sheets, sheets, sheets
And smoke us a cigarette
And go back to sleep, sleep, sleep

'Cause we done got a
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption

I was all in the club havin' a drink, blowin' on a sweet
When I peeped this little freak out
I was all on the bar when drifter shawty redd came on
Then she hit the floor, now

With a see through dress, long hair, light brown eyes
Lookin' like Miss Bo Peep
And a playa know if I take her home
With them real thick hips, you so right I'm gon' beat

So I approached the chick with the real pretty face
Nice curves on her with a lil bitty waist
I whispered in her ear, "Lil momma, what you drank?
I know that you're a freak
But you know I aint gon say shh"

See my game is outrageous
I got into the crib and exchanged some love faces
But it wasn't no need for me to rush to bust one
Cus I wanted her to have an eruption

Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption

Sexual eruption
(All the time, any time)
Sexual eruption
Sexual eruption
