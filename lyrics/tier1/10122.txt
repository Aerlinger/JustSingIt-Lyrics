This is a J-Lack track man

I guess I can let this woman slip away
'Cause I got my eye on you
I see ya lookin' over your shoulder
Let me make my way over

Excuse me miss lady, how ya doin'?
Your body lookin' right, you're type I like and I'm pursuin'
Can I get a little closer, so I can get to know you
And exchange names and thangs, before the night is over, uh

All I really want is for you to back it up
Go on and put your weight on it
'Cause it's alright, do what you wanna
Make me believe ya, ooh, I wanna see ya

Get it shawty, get it shawty
Get it shawty, get it shawty, oh, oh, oh, oh
G-g-get it shawty, get it shawty
Get it shawty, get it shawty, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I guess if I can let the night just drift away
So baby whatcha gon' do?
'Cause I don't wanna lose it
Come on keep it movin'

Excuse me miss lady, how ya doin'?
Your body lookin' right, you're type I like and I'm pursuin'
Can I get a little closer, so I can get to know you
And exchange names and thangs, before the night is over, uh

All I really want is for you to back it up
Go on and put your weight on it
'Cause it's alright, do what you wanna
Make me believe ya, ooh, I wanna see ya

Get it shawty, get it shawty
Get it shawty, get it shawty, oh, oh, oh, oh
G-g-get it shawty, get it shawty
Get it shawty, get it shawty, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Jeans tight, high heels, this is how you make me feel
Lips glossed, teeth white, apple bottoms let me bite
Spend the night, catch a flight, we can do what, what you like
Feelin' righteous, smelling good, let's get this understood

Is there something you're not telling me?
Are you the daughter of Frankie Beverly?
It's the way you move, the way you groove
I'ma fan, and you're the celebrity
She good at freaky stuff, shawty got me geeked up
Like Faybo, I got Play-doh, let me show you street love

All I really want is for you to back it up
Go on and put your weight on it
'Cause it's alright, do what you wanna
Make me believe ya, ooh, I wanna see ya

Get it shawty, get it shawty
Get it shawty, get it shawty, oh, oh, oh, oh
G-g-get it shawty, get it shawty
Get it shawty, get it shawty, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
