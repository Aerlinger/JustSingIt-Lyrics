I was blown away, what could I say?
It all seemed to make sense
You're taking away everything
And I can't deal with that

I try to see the good in life
But good things in life are hard to find
We're blowing away, blowing away
Can we make this something good?

Well, I'll try to do to it right this time around
Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around, it's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me but you're the only one
It's not over

I've taken all I can take and I cannot wait
We're wasting too much time
Being strong, holding on
Can't let it bring us down

My life with you means everything
So I won't give up that easily
Blowing away, blowing away
Can we make this something good?
'Cause it's all misunderstood

Well, I'll try to do to it right this time around
Let's start over
I'll try to do it right this time around, it's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me but you're the only one
It's not over

You can't let this get away
Let it out, let it out
Don't get caught up in yourself
Let it out

Let's start over
I'll try to do to it right this time around, it's not over
'Cause a part of me is dead and in the ground
This love is killing me but you're the only one
It's not over

Let's start over
It's not over, oh yeah
This love is killing me but you're the only one
It's not over
