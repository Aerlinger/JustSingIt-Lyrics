Uh, Timomatic

I, I see ya staring
What you wearing
Gucci, Chanel, it don't matter you're amazing
And I just wanna get you in my ride
Cause girl you been burning up in my mind

So let's walk walk over the bar
Fill it up up do a little dance stir it up up
Everybody knows what's up up
Come on let's move move loving all the things you do do
Girl I got my eyes on you you
You know you got it

Everybody, do you want it?
Let's get it started
Set it off! Set it off!
If you really want it
Let's get it started
Everybody
Set it off!

To all my people on the dance floor, set it off
We running hot we about to get low, set it off
And if you're sexy and you want more, set it off
Yeah yeah, set it off!
Yeah yeah, set it off!

Let's get it closer
Girl I got to know ya
No place I'd rather be than right here with ya
You work the body just the way I like
Got it going on make me lose my mind

So let's walk walk over the bar
Fill it up up do a little dance stir it up up

Girl I got my eyes on you you

We running hot we about to get low, set it off
