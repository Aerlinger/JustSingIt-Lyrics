Like a movie scene in the sweetest dreams
I had pictured us together
Now to feel your lips on my fingertips
I have to say is even better

Then I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life
All of my life, all of my life

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
Waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
Waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight

Tender words you say, take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever

I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew, I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew, I had to hold on

Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I've dreamed of this love for so long

Waiting for tonight
(Tonight, tonight)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
(Tonight, tonight)
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
