You are young and so am I
And this is wrong but who am I to judge?
You feel like heaven when we touch
I guess for me this is enough

We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

You are young and I am scared
You're wise beyond your years but I don't care
And I can feel your heart beat
You know exactly where to take me

We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh

"Will you remember me?"
You ask me as I leave
"Remember what?" I said
Oh, how could I, oh, how could I forget?

We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

We're one mistake from being together
But let's not ask why it's not right
You won't be seventeen forever
And we can get away with this tonight

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
