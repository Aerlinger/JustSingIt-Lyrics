I was lying on the grass on sunday morning of last week
Indulging in my self defeats
My mind was thugged, all laced and bugged, all twisted round and beat
Uncomfortable three feet deep
Now the fuzzy stare from not being there on a confusing morning week
Impaired my tribal lunar-speak
And of course you can't become if you only say what you would have done
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me
If you steal my sunshine
Making sure i'm not in too deep
If you steal my sunshine
Keeping versed and on my feet
If you steal my sunshine

I was frying on the bench slide in the park across the street
L-a-t-e-r that week
My sticky paws were into making straws out of big fat slurpy treats
An incredible eight foot heap
Now the funny glare to pay a gleaming tear in a staring under heat
Involved an under usual feat
And i'm not only among but I invite who I want to come
So I missed a million miles of fun

I know it's up for me
If you steal my sunshine
Making sure i'm not in too deep
If you steal my sunshine
Keeping versed and on my feet
If you steal my sunshine

I know it's done for me
If you steal my sunshine
Not something hard to see
If you steal my sunshine
Keeping dumb and built to beat
If you steal my sunshine
My sunshine
If you steal my sunshine
