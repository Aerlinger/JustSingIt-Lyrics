[Busta Rhymes]
Ok (ahh)
Yeahh (ahh)
Oh, we about to get it just a lil hot & sweaty in this (ooh, baby)
Ladies let's go (uhh)
Soldiers let's go (dolls)
Let me talk to y'all and just you know give you a little situation...
Listen (fellas)

[Busta Rhymes]
Ya see this get hot
Everytime I come through when I step up in the spot (are you ready)
Make the place sizzle like a summertime cookout
Prowl for the best chick
Yes I'm on the lookout (let's dance)
Slow bangin shorty like a belly dancer with it
Smell good, pretty skin, so gangsta with it (ooh, baby)
No tricks only diamonds under my sleeve
Gimme tha number
But make sure you call before you leave

[Pussycat Dolls]
I know you like me (I know you like me)
I know you do (I know you do)
That's why whenever I come around
She's all over you
And I know you want it (I know you want it)
It's easy to see (it's easy to see)
And in the back of your mind
I know you should be on with me
(Hot)

[Chorus]
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me
Don't you wish your girlfriend was a freak like me
Don't cha
Don't cha
Don't you wish your girlfriend was raw like me
Don't you wish your girlfriend was fun like me
Don't cha (haah aah)
Don't cha

Fight the feeling (fight the feeling)
Leave it alone (leave it alone)
Cause if it ain't love it just ain't enough
To leave a happy home (oh, oh)
Let's keep it friendly (let's keep it friendly)
You have to play fair (you have to play fair, yeah)
See, I don't care
But I know she ain't gon' wanna share (oh, oh)
Hmmmm....

[Chorus]
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me (oh)
Don't you wish your girlfriend was a freak like me (like me)
Don't cha - don't cha baby
Don't cha - alright, sing
Don't you wish your girlfriend was raw like me (raw)
Don't you wish your girlfriend was fun like me (big thrills)
Don't cha (haah aah)

[Busta Rhymes]
Ok, I see how it's goin' down (ahh, don't cha)
Seems like shorty wanna little menage pop off or somethin, let's go
Well let me get straight to it
Every broad wan watch a when I come through it
It's the god almighty, lookin all brand new
If shorty wanna jump in my aston vanqu-ish
Lookin' at me all like she really won do it
Tryna put it on me till my black an blueish
Ya wanna play wit ah playa girl then play on
Strip out the channel
And leave the lingerie on
Watch me and I'mma watch you at the same time
Lookin at ya wan break my back
You the very reason why I keep a pack ah the Magnum
An wit the wagon hit chu in the back of tha magnum
For the record, don't think it was somethin you did
Shorty all on me cuz it's hard to resist the kid
I got a idea that's dope for y'all
As y'all could get cool so I could hit the both of y'all

[Pussycat Dolls]
See, I know she loves you (I know she loves you)
I understand (I understand)
I'd probably be just as crazy about you
If you were my own man
Maybe next lifetime (maybe next lifetime)
Possibly (possibly)
Until then, oh friend you're secret is
Safe with me
(Hot!)

[Chorus]
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me (oh)
Don't you wish your girlfriend was a freak like me (like me)
Don't cha - don't cha baby
Don't cha - alright, sing
Don't you wish your girlfriend was raw like me (raw)
Don't you wish your girlfriend was fun like me (big thrills)
Don't cha (haah aah)
Don't cha

(Ah!)
(Ah!)
