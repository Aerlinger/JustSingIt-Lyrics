You should know that I love you
We should love like lovers do
And I cant help but fall for you
Oh honey, Im just a fool
Now you know

Darling, Ill never be true
You see, for so long I was blue
Im not the lonely one
And if I hurt, then you would too
Oh honey, I always lose
Now you know

Lover, when will you?
I'm so afraid that no one cares
Lover, can't find you
I swear to God don't leave me here
Now you know

Oh, you know that it can't be
When no one else here really means
Anything to me
If you hurt inside, if you confide in me again

Since you ran away
Hold me now
Tell me how
Love is ours

Lover, when will you?
I'm so afraid that no one cares
Lover, can't find you
And no one knows what brings us here

Lover
Hold me now
Hold me now
Tell me how
Love is ours
