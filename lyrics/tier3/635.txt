Hate, something, sometime, someway, something kick off the floor for
Mine? Something, inside
I'll never ever follow
So give me something that is for real
I'll never ever follow

Get your boogie on
Get your boogie on

Hate, something, someway, each day, dealing with no forgiveness
Why? This shit inside
Now everyone will follow
So give me nothing just feel
And now this shit will follow

God paged me, you'll never see the lie, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say
God paged me, you'll never see the lie, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say

Each day I can feel it swallow, inside something they took from me
I don't feel your deathly ways
Each day I feel so hollow, inside I was beating me
You will never see, so come dance with me

Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me
Dance with me

God paged me, you'll never see the lie, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life, oh I say
God paged me, you'll never see the lie, who wants to see?
God told me, I've already got the life
Got the life, got the life, got the life
Got the life, got the life, got the life
Got the life, got the life, got the life
