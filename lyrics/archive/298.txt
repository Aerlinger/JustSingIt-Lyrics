	<li><p>She got eyes that cut you like a knife</p></li>
	<li><p>And lips that taste like sweet red wine</p></li>
	<li><p>And pretty legs go to heaven every time</p></li>
	<li><p>She got a gentle way that puts me at ease</p></li>
	<li><p>When she walks in the room, I can hardly breathe</p></li>
	<li><p>Got a devastating smile, knock a grown man to his knees</p></li>
	<li><p>She got whatever it is</p></li>
	<li><p>It blows me away</p></li>
	<li><p>She's everything I wanted to say to a woman</p></li>
	<li><p>But couldn't find the words to say</p></li>
	<li><p>She got whatever it is</p></li>
	<li><p>I don't know what to do</p></li>
	<li><p>And every time I try and tell her how I feel</p></li>
	<li><p>It comes out "I love you"</p></li>
	<li><p>You got whatever it is</p></li>
	<li><p>You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay</p></li>
	<li><p>Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day</p></li>
	<li><p>But that all changed when she walked into my life</p></li>
	<li><p>And people askin’ why it is</p></li>
	<li><p>I tell them I don't know</p></li>
	<li><p>Just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire</p></li>
	<li><p>And she's gonna be my wife</p></li>
	<li><p>She got whatever it is</p></li>
	<li><p>It blows me away</p></li>
	<li><p>She's everything I wanted to say to a woman</p></li>
	<li><p>But couldn't find the words to say</p></li>
	<li><p>She got whatever it is</p></li>
	<li><p>I don't know what to do</p></li>
	<li><p>Every time I try and tell her how I feel</p></li>
	<li><p>It comes out "I love you"</p></li>
	<li><p>You got whatever it is</p></li>
	<li><p>Now when she loves me</p></li>
	<li><p>Girl, that's how I feel</p></li>
	<li><p>When she loves me, I'm on top of the world</p></li>
	<li><p>When she loves me, I can live forever</p></li>
	<li><p>When she loves me, I am untouchable</p></li>
	<li><p>You got whatever it is</p></li>
	<li><p>It blows me away</p></li>
	<li><p>You're everything I wanted to say to a woman</p></li>
	<li><p>But couldn't find the words to say</p></li>
	<li><p>You got whatever it is</p></li>
	<li><p>I don't know what to do</p></li>
	<li><p>Every time I try and tell her how I feel</p></li>
	<li><p>It comes out "I love you, I do"</p></li>
	<li><p>You got whatever it is</p></li>
	<li><p>Oh, you got whatever it is</p></li>
