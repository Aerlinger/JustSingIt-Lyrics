Hey, hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it
Whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, cuz I'ma do it, cuz I'ma do it
Whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it

Hey, hey, hey, big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option

Now do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, cuz I'ma do it, cuz I'ma do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it

Now let me hear ya say big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option

Now do it to the maximum, take it while you askin' 'em
Don't listen to them suckers when they say you too irrational
I said I was "King" and them lames started laughin' and
Same suckers now want the King on a track with 'em

I composed several classicals, you know like "Top Back"
"Dope Boy", "Bring 'Em Out", and "What You Know About That"
Now they ask how I talk, what you know about that?
Dominated '06, now I'm goin' right back, do it

See me rain hell, I just showed you like that
Even Denzel say, "Damn, I ain't know it like that"
Nigga yeah, still Bankhead, you can tell
Ain't nothin' changed but the name on the mail

I still kick in doors with them thangs in the air
Up in Benihana's, see me slang in the chair
I will slang 'caine, no such thing as a jail
Say you need a hundred squares? It just came off the scale

Let's do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, cuz I'ma do it, cuz I'ma do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it

Now let me hear ya say big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option

Now do it like a ball player, where you see me ball at?
Stacks tall as ball players, from the stage to the air
Whether in Miami, Cincinnati, or the Riverdale
Arizona, California, you make it rain anywhere

Pullin' out that pistol nigga, who you think you fin' to scare?
Twenty rounds of missiles'll have you pissin' in your underwear
I tote about 40 cal so you better tone it down
Or I suggest you just prepare yourself for when it goin' down

A-Town, West Side, clubs where you'll catch me
Right up at the top where Big Kuntry, Dro, and Mack be
Jackers lie, say they caught me slippin', how could that be?
I'm something like a stalker, I be e'rywhere the strap be

The trap be, jumpin' with them hundred dollar slabs
If I want it nigga, I could get a hundred on the tab
Sell 'em all, double down, nigga do the math
Think I won't pull up in something with 200 on the dash?

Yeah I do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, cuz I'ma do it, cuz I'ma do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it

Now let me hear ya say big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option

Now I do it like I wanna do it, do that shit in front of you
Real nigga vision pimpin', I ain't seein' none of you
I do it for my nigga Phil's daughter and his mama too
I do it for my oldest sons and their grandmama too

Do it for my daughters and my youngest son's mama who
Go buy what she want because she know it ain't a problem to
You do something to them and to you I'll bring the drama to
You do it for a day or so, we do it for a month or two

I do it for my partners, go make sure them niggas stuntin' too
We do it with them choppers, ain't no problem, where you runnin' to?
We do it for the block, that why ain't nobody stoppin' me
I do it for my pop and my cousins too, they watchin' me

I did it nonstop, now see how these niggas copy me?
I made it from the bottom to the top where I oughta be
Who do it did good and do it did fresh
No matter what I do you know I do it to death

Hey I'ma do it, you better do it, you better do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, cuz I'ma do it, cuz I'ma do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you know we do it, you know we do it
Hey whatchu waitin' for?
Do it, you better do it, you better do it

Now let me hear ya say big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Big shit poppin' and little shit stoppin'
Ball on these niggas, bein' broke is not an option
Now do it
