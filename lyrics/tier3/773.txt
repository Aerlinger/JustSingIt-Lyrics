Is there a God?
Is he watching?
Is she watching?
Are they watching now?
If not, what are we doing?
Where are we going?
What are we doing now?

Look at all these people
Searching for a reason,
Searching for a piece of mind. Hey!

They say we're all created equal,
That's what they teach us,

But that ain't how we treat each other
Nah that ain't how we treat each other
Shit, the truth is that we need each other, yeah

Diamond in the back,
Babies on crack,
Kickin' the door,
Waving the four four
White-collared war crime, money gets spent
Just candles in the sun, blowing in the wind
Sun goes down.
Heroes often get shot
Peace has long been forgot
Ohh it'll be too late when we find out
We're all that we got
Take a look around now
Just take a look around

Business and governments just watch as the innocent fade.
Mindless bureaucracy fails, hindering government aid.

Aren't you appalled?
What are we doing?
Where are we going?
What are we doing?

Diamond in the back,
Babies on crack,
Kickin' the door,
Waving the four four
White-collared war crime, money gets spent
Candles in the sun, blowing in the wind
Sun goes down.
Heroes often get shot
Peace has long been forgot
Ohh will it be too late when we find out?
We're all that we got
Take a look around now
Just take a look around

May we all live long
And may we all be brave
And the bridges we burn, only light our way

May we all be strong
And may we all be brave
And the bridges we burn, only light our way

May we all live long
May we all be brave
And the bridges we burn, only light our way

May we all live long
And we all be brave
And the bridges we burn, will be the bridges we burn.

Is there a God?
Is he watching?
Is she watching?
Are they watching now?
Is there a God?
I'm sure he's watching.
What are we doing?
Where are we going?
Take a look around now

We're all that we got.
