When we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colours on our skin
We were light and paper-thin
And when we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colours on our skin
Till you let the spectrum in
Say my name,
And every colour illuminates,
We are shining,
And well never be afraid again.
Say my name!
As every colour illuminates!
We are shining!
And well never be afraid again!
Say my name!
As every colour illuminates!
We are shining!
And well never be afraid again!
And when we come for you,
Well be dressed up all in blue,
With the ocean in our arms,
Kissing eyes and kissing palms.
And when its time to pray,
Well be dressed up all in grey,
With metal on our tongues,
And silver in our lungs.
Say my name,
And every colour illuminates,
We are shining,
And well never be afraid again.
Say my name!
As every colour illuminates!
We are shining!
And well never be afraid again!
Say my name!
As every colour illuminates!
We are shining!
And well never be afraid again!
And when we come back well be dressed in black!
And youll scream our names aloud!
And we wont eat and we wont sleep!
Well drag bodies from their graves!
So say my name,
And every colour illuminates,
And we are shining,
And well never be afraid again,
Say my name,
As every colour illuminates.
Say my name!
As every colour illuminates!
We are shining!
And well never be afraid again!
Say my name!
As every colour illuminates!
We are shining!
And well never be afraid again!
Say my name!
We are shining!
Say my name!
Say my name!
And well never be afraid again!
