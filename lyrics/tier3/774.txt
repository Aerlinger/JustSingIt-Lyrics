I really hate to see that look on your face
You're looking like someone came and rained on your parade
And I know it kills to feel those tears in your eyes
But I guess your conscience finally caught up with your lies

But when my tears dried,
where the hell were you
It's okay, boy, I've changed
and I ain't been there waiting
So I won't pretend
to feel bad for you
Cuz since you left, I ain't cried since
and, boy, I like it that way

[Hook]
I can say I'm done in a million ways
But let's not beat around the bush
Let's cut to the chase
(And you changed, I changed, but it's too late)
Now I'm so through,
too cool on you
And if our love was a game you just lost
(And you changed, I changed, but it's too late)

I know you hate to see this look on my face
I'm sure that you can see real clear a little lying goes a long way
And if you think I'll waste more tears, boy, your crazy
And maybe you should get yourself admitted, don't delay

But you let the ball drop,
too bad for you
But it's okay, boy, I'm straight
my whole life's amazing
So I won't pretend
to feel bad for you
Cuz since you left, I ain't cried since
and, boy, I like it that way

[Hook]
I can say I'm done in a million ways
But let's not beat around the bush
Let's cut to the chase
(And you changed, I changed, but it's too late)
Now I'm so through,
too cool on you
And if our love was a game you just lost
(And you changed, I changed, but it's too late)

Now you wanna claim you got a clue
Boy what'd you expect for me to do
You claim you want to have a life for two
But you can save your "sorry"s and your "I love you" too

[Hook]
I can say I'm done in a million ways
But let's not beat around the bush
Let's cut to the chase
(And you changed, I changed, but it's too late)
Now I'm so through,
too cool on you
And if our love was a game you just lost
(And you changed, I changed, but it's too late)
