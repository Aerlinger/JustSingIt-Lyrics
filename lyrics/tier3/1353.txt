This much delight, fills columns to new heights
All these things about me you never can tell
Colors run prime, paint a picture so bright
All these things about me you never can tell
You make me sleep so badly invisible friend

Turn the dial on my words
I can feel they fall short
Turn the dial, chime alarm, chime alarm
Watch these hands move apart
Turn the dial on my words

I can see you staying here

Fierce steps shadow, life's will gone shallow
All these things about me you never can tell
You make me sleep so badly, invisible friend
You make me sleep so badly, invisible friend
You make me sleep so badly, invisible friend

Turn the dial on my words
I can feel they fall short
Turn the dial, chime alarm, chime alarm
Watch these hands move apart
Turn the dial on my words

I can see you staying here
