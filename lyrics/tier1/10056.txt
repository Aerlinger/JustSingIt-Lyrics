People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?
People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?

So with different colors and with different creeds
And different people have different needs
It's obvious you hate me though I've done nothing wrong
I've never even met you, so what could I have done?

I can't understand what makes a man hate another man
Help me understand, help me understand, help me understand

[Inaudible] decency
Surely this is head to your fist

I can't understand what makes a man hate another man
Help me understand

People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?
People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?

Now you're punchin' and you're kickin' and you're shoutin' at me
I'm relyin' on your common decency
So far it hasn't surfaced but I'm sure it exists
It just takes a while to travel from your head to your fist

Help me understand, help me understand

People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?
People are people so why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully?

I can't understand what makes a man hate another man
Help me understand
I can't understand what makes a man hate another man
(People are people so why should it be)
Help me understand
I can't understand what makes a man hate another man
(People are people so why should it be)
Help me understand
