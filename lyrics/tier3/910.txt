Don't know where I'm going
I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling
Gotta row

Moving is Breathing and breathing is life
stopping is dying, you'll be alright
life is a hammer waiting to drop
adrift in the shallows and the rowing won't stop

Don't know where I'm going
I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling
Gotta row

Can't see the sky, nothing on the horizon
can't feel my hands and the water keeps rising
can't fall asleep, cause i'll wake up dead
I just keep on pulling, I just keep on rowing, Don't know where I'm going

Don't know where I'm going
I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling
Gotta row

Rowing is living and living is hard
but living beats losing all that we are
and all that we know of, and all that we feel
and all we remember, imagined or real
I heard an echo, but the answer had changed
from the word I remember, that I started out saying
living is cheating if you're not pulling oars
but the current is leaving, I'll get mine, you'll get yours

Don't know where I'm going
I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling
Gotta row

Rowing is bleeding and bleeding is breathing
breathing is feeling, burning or freezing
keep getting dirty, but I started out clean
keep on pulling, I keep on pulling, I keep on rolling, I keep on rolling

Don't know where I'm going
I just keep on rowing
I just keep on pulling
Gotta row
