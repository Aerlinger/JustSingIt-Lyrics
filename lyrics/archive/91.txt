	<li><p>Days like this I want to drive away</p></li>
	<li><p>Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade</p></li>
	<li><p>You chewed me up and spit me out</p></li>
	<li><p>Like I was poison in your mouth</p></li>
	<li><p>You took my light, you drained me down</p></li>
	<li><p>But that was then and this is now</p></li>
	<li><p>Now look at me</p></li>
	<li><p>This is the part of me</p></li>
	<li><p>That you're never gonna ever take away from me</p></li>
	<li><p>This is the part of me</p></li>
	<li><p>That you're never gonna ever take away from me</p></li>
	<li><p>Throw your sticks and stones</p></li>
	<li><p>Throw your bombs and your blows</p></li>
	<li><p>But you're not gonna break my soul</p></li>
	<li><p>This is the part of me</p></li>
	<li><p>That you're never gonna ever take away from me</p></li>
	<li><p>I just wanna throw my phone away</p></li>
	<li><p>Find out who is really there for me</p></li>
	<li><p>You ripped me off, your love was cheap</p></li>
	<li><p>Was always tearing at the seams</p></li>
	<li><p>I fell deep, you let me drown</p></li>
	<li><p>But that was then and this is now</p></li>
	<li><p>Now look at me</p></li>

	<li><p>This is the part of me</p></li>
	<li><p>That you're never gonna ever take away from me</p></li>
	<li><p>Now look at me, I'm sparkling</p></li>
	<li><p>A firework, a dancing flame</p></li>
	<li><p>You won't ever put me out again</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm glowing, oh woah oh</p></li>
	<li><p>So you can keep the diamond ring</p></li>
	<li><p>It don't mean nothin' anyway</p></li>
	<li><p>In fact you can keep everything</p></li>
	<li><p>Yeah, yeah</p></li>
	<li><p>Except for me</p></li>
	<li><p>This is the part of me</p></li>
