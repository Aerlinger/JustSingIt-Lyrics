	<li><p>All of my change I spent on you</p></li>
	<li><p>Where have the times gone</p></li>
	<li><p>Baby, it's all wrong</p></li>
	<li><p>Where are the plans we made for two?</p></li>
	<li><p>Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember</p></li>
	<li><p>The people we used to be</p></li>
	<li><p>It's even harder to picture</p></li>
	<li><p>That you're not here next to me</p></li>
	<li><p>You say it's too late to make it</p></li>
	<li><p>But is it too late to try?</p></li>
	<li><p>And in our time that you wasted</p></li>
	<li><p>All of our bridges burned down</p></li>
	<li><p>I've wasted my nights</p></li>
	<li><p>You turned out the lights</p></li>
	<li><p>Now I'm paralyzed</p></li>
	<li><p>Still stuck in that time when we called it love</p></li>
	<li><p>But even the sun sets in paradise</p></li>

	<li><p>Baby, it's all wrong</p></li>
	<li><p>Where are the plans we made for two?</p></li>
	<li><p>If happy ever after did exist</p></li>
	<li><p>I would still be holding you like this</p></li>
	<li><p>All those fairytales are full of shit</p></li>
	<li><p>One more fuckin’ love song, I'll be sick</p></li>
	<li><p>You turned your back on tomorrow</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause you forgot yesterday</p></li>
	<li><p>I gave you my love to borrow</p></li>
	<li><p>But you just gave it away</p></li>
	<li><p>You can't expect me to be fine</p></li>
	<li><p>I don't expect you to care</p></li>
	<li><p>I know I've said it before</p></li>
	<li><p>But all of our bridges burned down</p></li>
	<li><p>I've wasted my nights</p></li>
	<li><p>You turned out the lights</p></li>

	<li><p>Now I'm at a payphone</p></li>
	<li><p>Man, fuck that shit</p></li>
	<li><p>I'll be out spending all this money while you sitting ‘roundp></li>
	<li><p>Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothing</p></li>
	<li><p>Made it from the bottom</p></li>
	<li><p>Now when you see me I'm stunning</p></li>
	<li><p>And all of my cars start with the push of a button</p></li>
	<li><p>Telling me the chances I blew up or whatever you call it</p></li>
	<li><p>Switched the number to my phone</p></li>
	<li><p>So you never could call it</p></li>
	<li><p>Don't need my name on my show</p></li>
	<li><p>You can tell it I'm ballin'</p></li>
	<li><p>Swish, what a shame could have got picked</p></li>
	<li><p>Had a really good game but you missed your last shot</p></li>
	<li><p>So you talk about who you see at the top</p></li>
	<li><p>Or what you could've saw</p></li>
	<li><p>But sad to say it's over for</p></li>
	<li><p>Phantom pulled up valet open doors</p></li>
	<li><p>Wiz like go away, got what you was looking for</p></li>
	<li><p>Now ask me who they want</p></li>
	<li><p>So you can go and take that little piece of shit with you</p></li>
