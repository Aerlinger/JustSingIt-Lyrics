This is not the end,
This is not the beginning,
Just a voice like a riot
Rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone
And the violent rhythm,
Though the words sound steady,
Something empty's within 'em,

We say "Yeah!"
With our fists flying up in the air,
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there,
'Cause we're living at the mercy of
The pain and the fear
Until we dead it, forget it,
Let it all disappear.

Waiting for the end to come...
Wishing I had strength to stand...
This is not what I had planned...
It's out of my control....

Flying at the speed of light,
Thoughts were spinning in my head.
So many things were left unsaid.
It's hard to let you go...

(Oh!) I know what it takes to move on,
I know how it feels to lie,
All I wanna do
Is trade this life for something new,
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last,
I wish it wasn't so...

(Oh!) I know what it takes to move on,
I know how it feels to lie,
All I wanna do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got!

What was left when the fire was gone?
I thought I found right but that right was wrong.
All caught up in the eye of the storm.
I'm trying to figure out what it's like - moving on.
And I don't even know what kind of things I've said,
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead.
So picking up the pieces, now, where to begin?
The hardest part of ending is starting all again.

All I wanna do
Is trade this life for something new,
Holding on to what i haven't got!..

This is not the end,
This is not the beginning,
Just a voice like a riot
Rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone
And the violet rhythm,
Though the words sound steady,
Something empty's within 'em
(Holding on to what I haven't got!)

We say "Yeah!"
We're fists fighting up in the air,
Like we're holding onto something
That's invisible there,
'Cause we're living at the mercy of
The pain and the fear
Until we get it, forget it,
Let it all disappear!
(Holding on to what I haven't got!)
