Come on people let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell you what you gotta do

If you wanna live your life
Live it all the way and don't you waste it
Every feeling, every beat
Can be so very sweet you gotta taste it

You gotta do it
(You gotta do it)
You gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
(You gotta prove it)
You gotta mean what you say
(Come on, you know what we're here for!)
You gotta do it
(Do it)
You gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
(Prove it)
You gotta mean what you say

Life's a party, make it hot
Dance, don't ever stop whatever rhythm
Every minute, every day
Take them all the away, you gotta live them
'Cause I'ma live my life)

You gotta do it
(You gotta do it)
You gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
(You gotta prove it)
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it
(Do it)
You gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
You gotta mean what you say

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell you what you gotta do

'Cause I'ma live my life
Eso
'Cause I'ma live my life
'Cause I'ma live my life

Ay papi, let's get down

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Let's get loud, pomp it up

Life is meant to be, be funny
You're not hurting anyone, nobody loses
Let the music make you free
Be what you wanna be
Make no excuses

You gotta do it
(Do what you wanna do)
You gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
(Say what you wanna say)
You gotta mean what you say
You gotta do it
(Go where you wanna go)
You gotta do it your way
You gotta prove it
(Just do it oh)
You gotta mean what you say

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell you what you gotta do

Let's get loud, let's get loud
Turn the music up to hear that sound
Let's get loud, let's get loud
Ain't nobody gotta tell you what you gotta do

Eso
Asi, asi es que me gusta, tu sabes
