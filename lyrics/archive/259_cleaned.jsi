You gotta help me out
It's all a blur last night
We need a taxi 'cause your hung over and I'm broke
I lost my fake ID
But you lost the motel key
Spare me your freakin'
Dirty looks now don't blame me
You wanna cash out
And get the @#$% outta town
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Why are these lights so bright
Did we get hitched last night
Dressed up like Elvis
Why am I wearing your class ring
Don't call your mother
'Cause now we're partners in crime
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
You got me into this
Information over load
Situation lost control
Send out an S.O.S.
And get some cash out
We're gonna tear up the town
Don't be a baby
Remember what you told me
Remember what you told me
Ooh yeah
Shut up and put your money where your mouth is
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
Get up and shake the glitter off your clothes now
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
That's what you get baby
That's what you get for waking up in Vegas
