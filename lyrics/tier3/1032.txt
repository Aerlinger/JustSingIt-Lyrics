I'm growing like a seed
Rains been falling on me
I've been covered in cold
I've been shrouded and downed
My heart is on a wire
Sailing pretty like a bird
But the hunter is out
And the eagle is hurt

The word that I
Feel, feel it all
Yes, I can feel
Feel it all

I'm looking to the sky
And I'll be listening to the stars
And maybe thinking of you
And wondering where you are
Do you know what you've done for me
You made my branches grow
Now they can play with the wind
And they can carry the snow

And they can feel
Feel it all
Yes, they can feel,
Feel it all

So take what you want
Leave what you don't need
And I'll go looking for you
You keep your eye out for me
'cause our heart is on a wire
Sitting pretty like a bird
But the hunter is hunting
And the eagle is us

And we can feel
Feel it all
Yes, we can feel
Feel it all

Oh, we can feel
Feel it all
Oh, we can feel
Feel it all
Feel, feel
Feel it all
And we can
Feel, feel it all

Feel, feel
Feel it all
Oh, we can
Feel, feel
we can feel
feel it all
Feel, feel
Feel it all
