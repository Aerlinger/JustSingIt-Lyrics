I see your dirty face high behind your collar
What is done in vain, truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God to justify the way you live a lie
Live a lie, live a lie

And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I made mine!

Because when I arrive, I-I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Now the son's disgraced, he who knew his father
When he cursed his name turned and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart so he stuck his middle finger to the world
To the world, to the world

And you take your time
And you stand in line
Where you'll get what's yours
I got mine!

Because when I arrive, I-I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Yeah! Wayne's World, Planet Rock
Panties drop and the tops
And she gon' rock 'til the camera stop
I sing about angels like Angela

(Rock!)
And Pamela
(Rock!)
And Samantha
(Rock!)
And Amanda
And Tamara mnage moi

Im in here like, "Bitch, what's up?"
Mechanic me, I could fix ya up
I could dick ya up, I could dick ya down
Shorty we could go wherever just pick a town

And my jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big ass rocks like on the ground
Dirty like sex that's on the ground
Weezy

Because when I arrive, I-Ill bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Because when I arrive, I-Ill bring the fire
Make you come alive, I can take you higher
What this is, forgot? I must now remind you
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock

Just let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
(Rock, rock)
Let it rock!
Let it rock!

I'm back like I forgot somethin', I'm somethin'
Roll and rock rubbin', rap runnin'
Miles like just tryin' to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne a personal trainer
My aim is perfect, I bang ya
Period, like the remainder

I wish I could be as cruel as you
And I wish I could say the things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No, not this time
