Y'all know what this is

Only thing that keeps me up when I'm feelin' down
I don't know about you but I gotta keep mines around
'Cuz I done looked, I done searched
And it's hard to find another shorty like mine

Baby, yes, I'm addicted to how we kick it everything you say to me
Never knew it could be so wicked, hopin' that you stay wit me
Search around the world but you will never find
Another shorty like mine, shorty like mine

You got a girl but she ain't nothin' like mine
Cute face nice size like mine
Fake kitted hood wit it like mine
Lean walk, talk the talk let me tell you some more

I knew, when I ran into this one
She would be the re drum of my pimpin'
Knew she would be the one
To make me stop caring about other girls
On my jock and gettin' them

She was the one to slow me down, hold me down
I roll wit' her know go wit' it now
I'ma grow wit' it now I'ma go get her that's how
I got her, don't be mad you can't get one
Hotta broke the mold when they made lil' momma

I don't care what my niggas say
She been there everyday for my drama
Some of the homies hate 'cuz they want her wish
They the ones that's datin' my woman
Gone get a good look 'cuz she fine and I don't mind 'cuz she mine

Only thing that keeps me up when I'm feelin' down
I don't know about you but I gotta keep mines around
'Cuz I done looked, I done searched
And it's hard to find another shorty like mine

Baby, yes, I'm addicted to how we kick it everything you say to me
Never knew it could be so wicked, hopin' that you stay wit me
Search around the world but you will never find
Another shorty like mine, shorty like mine

You got a girl but she ain't nothin' like mine
Cute face nice size like mine
Fake kitted hood wit' it like mine
Lean walk, talk the talk, let me tell you some more

All this love inside of me
And all I wanna do is give it to her
I don't care wat the fellas say 'bout it
'Cuz I got somethin' to say 'bout it
What I'm about to say is straight up
Real talk no cut I don't play bout' it

There ain't a price you can put on a girl
Who knows just wat to say when
You need to hear it the most
And I'ma tell you somethin' else
If I don't know nothin' else I know

Only thing that keeps me up when I'm feelin' down
I don't know about you but I gotta keep mines around
'Cuz I done looked, I done searched
And it's hard to find another shorty like mine

Baby, yes, I'm addicted to how we kick it everything you say to me
Never knew it could be so wicked, hopin' that you stay wit me
Search around the world but you will never find
Another shorty like mine, shorty like mine

You got a girl but she ain't nothin' like mine
Cute face nice size like mine
Fake kitted hood wit it like mine
Lean walk, talk the talk, let me tell you some more

I wanna give her the world
And I ain't even tryna lose her
I'm addicted to my girl and the way
That she twirks in that little skirt
Just for me in the club in the crib

In the streets, she reps for LB Dub, ENT
She a nice size with the pretty brown bright eyes
I'm a winner wit' the right prize
I'ma give it to her to the rhythm of a hi-hat
She got a beautiful mind, you can't buy that
And the site from behind when she walk on by make a

Nigga wanna try that she got the prettiest smile
And she gangsta keep me from runnin' wild
And I thank her and we can talk about
Anything she got good conversation
My homie little friend and plus she patient

Only thing that keeps me up when I'm feelin' down
I don't know about you but I gotta keep mines around
'Cuz I done looked, I done searched
And it's hard to find another shorty like mine

Baby, yes, I'm addicted to how we kick it everything you say to me
Never knew it could be so wicked, hopin' that you stay wit me
Search around the world but you will never find
Another shorty like mine, shorty like mine

You got a girl but she ain't nothin' like mine
Cute face nice size like mine
Fake kitted hood wit it like mine
Lean walk talk the talk let me tell you some more

Only thing that keeps me up when I'm feelin' down
I don't know about you but I gotta keep mines around
'Cuz I done looked, I done searched
And it's hard to find another shorty like mine

Baby, yes, I'm addicted to how we kick it everything you say to me
Never knew it could be so wicked, hopin' that you stay wit me
Search around the world but you will never find
Another shorty like mine, shorty like mine
