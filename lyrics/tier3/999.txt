When you dream you only dream your Annabel.
All the secrets there inside you Annabel.

Bound beneath an emerald sky sing Annabel.
Nothing that they did will stop you Annabel.

Land of the lines, tangled there in porcelain.
Under the stars you'll begin.

When you dream you only dream your Annabel.
Sleep reminds you takes you there, oh Annabel.

Gentle whisper, endless winters, Annabel.
Why've they could have let you be both Annabel.

Land of the lines, of the years below still lies.
You are the truth they denied.
Run like the sea, tangled there in porcelain.
Under the stars you begin.

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ah
(Only a boy under that)

Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh ah
(Only a boy da da da)
