Step by step, ooh baby
Gonna get to you girl
Step by step, girl

Step by step, ooh baby
Gonna get to you girl
Step by step, ooh baby
Really want you in my world

Step, hey girl
In your eyes, I see a picture of me all the time
Step and girl
When you smile, you've got to know that you drive me wild

Step by step, ooh baby
You're always on my mind
Step by step, ooh girl
I really think it's just a matter of time

Step by step, ooh baby
Gonna get to you girl
Step by step, ooh baby
Really want you in my world

Step, hey girl
Can't you see, I've got to have you all just for me
Step and girl
Yes, it's true, no one else will ever do

Step by step, ooh baby
You're always on my mind
Step by step, ooh girl
I really think it's just a matter of time

Step by step, ooh baby
Really want you in my world
Step by step, ooh baby
Gonna get to you girl

Step, step, step, step by step
Step one
We can have lots of fun
Step two
There's so much we can do
Step three
It's just you and me
Step four
I can give you more
Step five
Don't you know that the time is right

Step by step
Don't you know I need you
Step by step
Yes, I do, girl

Step by step, ooh baby
You're always on my mind
Step by step, ooh girl
I really think it's just a matter of time

Step by step, ooh baby
Gonna get to you girl
Step by step, ooh baby
Really want you in my world

Step by step, ooh baby
Gonna get to you girl
Step by step, ooh girl
Really want you in my world

Step by step, ooh baby
Gonna get to you girl
Step by step, ooh baby
