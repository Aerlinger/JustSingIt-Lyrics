Ah-hah.
Ah-hah-ooo. Ooooooooo....

Pray to God you can cope, I'll stand outside,
This woman's work, this woman's world.
Ooh, it's hard on the man; now his part is over.
Now starts the craft of the father.

I know you have a little life in you yet.
I know you've got a lot of strength left.
I know you've got a little life in you yet.
I know you have a lot of strength left

I should be crying but I just can't let it show
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking

All the things we should've said that I never said,
And all the things we should of done that we never did.
All the things we should've given but I didn't.

Ooh, darling make it go, make it go away.
Give me these moments, give them back to me.
Give me a little kiss, give me your, give me your hand, babe.
Give me that pretty hand to show you understand
My love, child.
Give me your hand, give me your hand.

I know you have a little life in you yet.
I know you have a little strength left.
I know you have a little life in you yet.
I know you have a little strength left.

I should be crying but I just can't let it go.
I should be hoping but I can't stop thinking, thinking, thinking...

Of all the things we should've said that we never said.
All the things we should've done that we never did.
All the things that you wanted from me,
All the things that that you needed from me.
All the things I should of given but I didn't.

Oh, darling make it go.
Just make it go away.
