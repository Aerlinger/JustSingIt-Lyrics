Welcome to the other side
You're lost
Baby satisfy your mind
You've been really gone
You've been really gone
You've been thinkin bout it baby since I put you on
She got money to blow
Just look at that nose

Prescription ain't it
You can mix it with the uh
And if you wanna do it, baby
I'll inhale with you
I'm on cloud 9
Baby you're behind
You can follow me

You can follow me if you want to
Go downtown with the drugs in your body
Take that step you're the life of the party
Know that step you're the life of the party

I got 2 little ladies
I got 1 little room
There's a room full of niggas
Baby what you wanna do?
The way you move got me feeling so uhh
I been thinking about it baby
I been thinking about it lately

I'm so far gone and you are too
Show me how you go downtown
With the drugs in your body
Take that step, you're the life of the party
Know that step, you're the life of the party

I love how you touch
How you feel
How you breath
Baby how you do it so good

How you twist with your hips got the room so slow baby
Girl please don't go
You're gonna please my boys
You been thinking about it baby

Yea you're a star
Oh you want my love?
Girl you love my time
Girl, there's 1 2 3
*Goooooo* Go downtown with the drugs in your body
Take that step you're the life of the party
Know that step you're the life of the party
