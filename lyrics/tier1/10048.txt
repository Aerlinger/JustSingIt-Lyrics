I come home in the mornin' light
My mother says, "When you gonna live your life right"
"Oh Mommy dear, we're not the fortunate ones
And girls, they wanna have fun
Woah girls, just wanna have fun"

The phone rings in the middle of the night
My father yells, "Whatcha gonna do with your life?"
"Oh Daddy dear, you know your still number one
But girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls, just wanna have"

Thats all they really want
Some fun
When the workin' day is done
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

(Girls they wanna)
(Wanna have fun now)
(Wanna have)

Some boys take a beautiful girl
And hide her away from the rest of the world
I wanna be the one to walk in the sun
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have

Thats all they really want
Some fun
When the workin' day is done
Oh girls they wanna have fun
Oh girls just wanna have fun

(Girls they wanna)
(Wanna have fun now)
(Wanna have)

They just wanna, they just wanna
(Girls, girls just wanna have fun)
They just wanna, they just wanna have fun
Girls just wanna have fun

(They just wanna, they just wanna)
They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, they just wanna have fun
(Girls, girls just wanna have fun)
Girls just wanna have fun

When the workin'
When the workin' day is done
Oh when the workin' day is done
Oh girls, girls just wanna have fun

They just wanna, they just wanna
They just wanna, they just wanna
Oh girls, girls just wanna have fun

(They just wanna, they just wanna)
When the workin'
(They just wanna, they just wanna)
When the workin' day is done
(Girls, girls just wanna have fun)
When the working day is done
Oh girl, girls just wanna have fun

(They just wanna, they just wanna)
