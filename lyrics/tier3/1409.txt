Well, can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside
But baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you
This song is meant to keep ya
From doing what you're supposed to

Like waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
I'll make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we can pretend it all the time, yeah
Can't you see that it's just raining
There ain't no need to go outside

But just maybe
Halaka ukulele mama made a baby
Really don't mind the practice
Cause you're my little lady

Lady, lady love me
Cause I love to lay here lazy
We could close the curtains
Pretend like there's no world outside
And we can pretend it all the time

And can't you see that it's just raining?
There ain't no need to go outside
Ain't no need, ain't no need
Can't you see, can't you see?
Rain all day and I don't mind

Telephone singing ringing
It's too early, don't pick it up
We don't need to
We got everything we need right here
And everything we need is enough

Just so easy
When the whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we really need to pay attention to the alarm?
Wake up slow, wake up slow

But baby, you hardly even notice
When I try to show you
This song is meant to keep ya
From doing what you're supposed to

Like waking up too early
Maybe we can sleep in
Ill make you banana pancakes
Pretend like it's the weekend now

And we can pretend it all the time
Can't you see that it's just raining?
Ain't no need to go outside

Ain't no need, ain't no need
Rain all day, I really
Really, really don't mind
Can't you see, can't you see?
You gotta wake up slow
