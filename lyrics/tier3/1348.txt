In the middle of the night
When the angels scream;
I don't wanna live a lie that I believe;
Time to do or die.

I will never forget
The moment, the moment.
I will never forget
The moment...
And the story goes oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woh!
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woh!
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woh-oh!
That's how the story goes.

That's how the story goes.

You and I'll never die.
It's a dark embrace.
In the beginning was the light of a dawning age.
Time to be alive.

I will never forget
The moment, the moment.
I will never forget this night we sing, we sing:
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woh!
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woh!
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woh-oh!
That's how the story goes.

Fate is coming - that I know!
Time is running - got to go!
Fate is coming - that I know!
Let it gooo-oh-oh!
Here right now
Under the banner of heaven
We dream out loud.

Do or die and the story goes
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woh-oh)
And the story goes
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woh!
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-woh-ohhh!
This is the story.
Fate is coming - that (this is the story) I know
Time is running - got (this is the story) to go
Fate is coming - that (this is the story) I know
Let it gooo-oh-oh!
Here right now
Under the banner of heaven
We dream out loud,dream out loud
Fate is coming - that (time to do or die) I know.
Time is running out. (time to do or die)
Fate is coming - that (time to do or die) I know.
Let it gooo, oh-oh!
