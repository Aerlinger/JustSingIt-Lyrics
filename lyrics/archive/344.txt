I can't help but wait, oh uh
Can't help but wait
Check it out, uh

I see you, you with him
He aint right but you dont trip
You stand by while he lies
Then turn right round and forgive

I cant take to see your face
With those tears runnin' down your cheeks
But what can I do, I gotta stay true
Because deep down Im still a G

And I dont want to come between you and your man
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

Girl I cant help but wait
Till you get that with him it dont change
Cant help but wait
Till you see that with me it aint the same

Cant help but wait
Till you see you for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I cant help but wait

Listen, it ain't fresh
To just let him call the shots
Youre a queen, you should be
Gettin' all that someones got

You should be rockin' the latest in purses
Bracelets and watches youre worth
Much more than an occasional
'I love you, Im thinking of you'

And I dont wanna come between you and your man, no
Even though I know I treat you better than he can

Girl I cant help but wait
Till you get that with him it dont change
Cant help but wait
Till you see that with me it aint the same

Cant help but wait
Till you see you for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I cant help but wait

Get it together
You can do better
See is believin'
And I see what you need so

Im going to play my position
Let you catch what youve been missing
Im calling out, girl cuz

I cant help but wait
Till you get that with him it dont change
Cant help but wait
Till you see that with me it aint the same

Cant help but wait
Till you see you for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I cant help but wait

Till you get that with him
It dont change
Cant help but wait
Till you see that with me it aint the same

Cant help but wait
Till you see you for what you really are
Baby girl you are a star
And I cant help but wait

Cant help but wait babe, no no no
I cant help but wait
Oh oh oh
Cant help wait
No, no, no
