It dont take much strength to pull a triggerBut try to get up every morning day after day and work for a livingLets see em try thatThen well see whos the real tough guyThe working man is a tough guy

[Hook - Alicia Keys]
Party people say, party people say
Ay its a new day, its a new day
World is gettin ready, everybodys ready, yeah!
For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye

[Dr Dre - Verse 1]
I woke up this morning thinking bout the old me
When I was feeling like, miller light and OE
But now I ride on some conscious shitIm getting bread while I toast to my accomplishments
Only one I can have a problem with is myselfIts probably why my only competition is myself
From today to the morning
The Doctor just rock to the same drum
Fuck the past, forgot where I came fromI got the club rockin, uhI got your girl jockin, uhMe and Fif still in this bitch
We going the distance with you party people come on

[Hook - Alicia Keys]

Party people say, party people sayAye its a new day, its a new dayWorld is gettin ready, everybodys ready, yeah!For a new day, for a new day, celebrate and say
A-A-A-A-A-A-A-Aye
[50 Cent]
Now you can get your knees on the Church floor break it better Or push the door on the liquor store, see where it get ya But me I got to be on top
I said me I get to be on top I got the street on lock
Im on automatic pilot Aint nobody stopping me
Growing up in poverty aint filled my heart with larceny Niggas ride out on high, I dump to get em off a me
Im a leader, natural born boss of me
They from Bel Air, Im from the bottom Soon as I spot em I get to drop em I got em
I cut my piece and I dot em
Its dinner time when the 9 come out
Its off the chain off,
off a the brain move
Bang, off with ya brain

[Hook - Alicia Keys]

[Bridge]

Clocks on the wall
Its now or never at all
Im gonna give it my all, oh-oooh
Whether I rise or fall, oh-oooh

[50 Cent]

True story I said Id get rich or die trying I did it,
good luck sucker, tryna stop my shine
Nothing matters but the music
Music my first love
We paper chasin, Im always coming in first cuz
Im built for it, see Im better under pressure
I react like a maniac when Im coming to get ya
I got to win, Em watch and Dre watch and my son watching
Fuck that, losing aint an option
Im sharp Im on point
The ink from my ballpoint
Throwing out my pain
Im back on my A-game
Im focused, for me this is just another victory
Except that Im stronger than an ox now mentally

[Hook - Alicia Keys]
