I backed my car into a cop car the other day
Well, he just drove off, sometimes life's okay
I ran my mouth off a bit too much, oh, what did I say?
Well, you just laughed it off, it was all okay

And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on anyway, well

A fake Jamaican took every last dime with a scam
It was worth it just to learn from sleight-of-hand
Bad news comes, don't you worry even when it lands
Good news will work it's way to all them plans
We both got fired on exactly the same day
Well, we'll float on, good news is on the way

And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, okay
And we'll all float on, alright

Already we'll all float on
Now don't you worry, we'll all float on
Alright, already we'll all float on
Alright, don't worry, we'll all float on

Alright, already and we'll all float on
Alright, already we'll all float on
Alright, don't worry even if things end up a bit too heavy
We'll all float on, alright

Already we'll all float on
Alright, already we'll all float on
Okay, don't worry, we'll all float on
Even if things get heavy, we'll all float on

Alright, already we'll all float on
Alright, no don't you worry, we'll all float on
Alright, all float on
