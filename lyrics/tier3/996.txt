Shoes for running
That will race ya
Sun is coming
Itll chase ya
Through this deadbeat town
Through this deadbeat town

The end is coming
I would race ya
But theres no running
Itll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down

What about the people thats barefoot with no shoes for running when the sun come up?
Hey 1 procenters, the 99 say what you gonna do for us?
Well run up in your house like the first runner up
Be the first one to rock and the last one to get laid down
Stay down and now we lookin at the top of the pound
Oh the nigga, the mountain, no our cap on
We vote patrone, nigga did 2 songs
Bubble gum, jet poppin off
Let em out like the nigga got all the hoes
Got all the dope and all the women
Why what you gonna do in the penitentiary?
Got a lot of money, cant take it with me
I cant take it with me
I wouldve stayed, consent me
To the moon and back with beautiful casa
And saved the lives of my great grandmamma
My great granddad and Ill pass the answer
To the question, but they make money off the medicine
Leave it less on stock in elections
With no progression, just recessions

Shoes for running
That will race ya
Sun is coming
Itll chase ya
Through this deadbeat town
Through this deadbeat town

The end is coming
I would race ya
But theres no running
Itll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down

Just as I expected, life gets deadly
Its funny how the beloved become the beheaded
The truth can be independent of direction that you stretchin
So my niggas well drop when shit gets sketchy
Its a masterpiece, a work of art,
A gallery, no photoshop
Pictures say a million words
So why does it let my photo funk
Even in your local top
Niggas that you know he boss
Every time our name is brought up better know its mobile top
Thats why she gives me geek til her shins weak
Im blazing every day, you can call it dealt week
Youre running from a life that you didnt see
Thats like playing hide and seek with the grim reaper

Shoes for running
That will race ya
Sun is coming
Itll chase ya
Through this deadbeat town
Through this deadbeat town

The end is coming
I would race ya
But theres no running
Itll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down

You can run but you cant hide
Spent your whole life tryin to escape
And everybodys safe
Bits are tired living in that life
Different lights, same towns
Sacrifice but we try cuz we know theres no getting out
And when the pawns are playin themselves I just lay and wait and its greater myself
Let em war wet out til the rhythm sails out
Breathe it back to life, give it mouth to mouth

Shoes for running
That will race ya
Sun is coming
Itll chase ya
Through this deadbeat town
Through this deadbeat town

The end is coming
I would race ya
But theres no running
Itll chase ya
Death will hunt you down
Death will hunt you down

You can fight and try to get away
But theres nowhere to run and hide to
Youd better know that there might come a day
Eventually its gon find you

You can fight and try to get away
But theres nowhere to run and hide to
Youd better know that there might come a day
Eventually its gon find you

Eventually its gon find you find you
Eventually its gon find you
Yea, Eventually its gon find you
And its gon find your ass, its gon find you
