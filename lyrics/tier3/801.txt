[Hook]
These bitches love Sosa
all in the know and
Fucking with those O boys, you gon' get fucked over
Rari's and Rovers
These hoes love Chief Sosa
Hit him with that cobra, now that boy slumped over
They do it all for Sosa
You boys ain't making no noise
Ya'll know I'm a grown boy
Your clique full of broke boys

We GBE dope boys, we got lots of dough boy

[Verse 1]
These bitches love Sosa
And they love them Glo' Boys
Know we from the 'Go boy
But we cannot go boy
No I don't know ol' Boy
I know he a broke boy
Rari's and Rover's
Convertibles in bulk boy
You know I got bands boy
And it's in my pants boy
Disrespect them O Boys
You won't speak again boy
Don't think that I'm playin boy
No we don't use hands boy
No we don't do friends boy
Collect bands I'm a land lord
I gets lotsa commas
I can fuck yo mama
I ain't with the drama
You can meet my llama
Ridin with 3hunna
With 300 foreigns
These bitches see Chief Sosa
I swear to god they all on

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Don't make me call D. Rose boy
He six double-o boy
And he keep that pole boy
You gon' get fucked over
Bitch I done sell soda, and I done sell coka
She gona' clap for Sosa
He gona' clap for Sosa
They do it for Sosa, them hoes they do it for Sosa
Tado off that Molly water
So nigga be cool like water, for you get hit with this lava
Bitch I'm the trending topic
Don't care no price I'll cop it b
And yo bitch steady jockin' me

[Hook]
