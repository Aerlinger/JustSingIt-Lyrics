Coming out your mouth with your blah, blah, blah
Zip your lips like a padlock
And meet me in the back
With the jack and the jukebox

I don't really care where you live at
Just turn around, boy, let me hit that
Don't be a little bitch with your chit chat
Just show me where your dick's at

Music starts, listen hot stuff
I'm in love with this song
So just hush, baby, shut up
Heard enough

Stop, talk, talk, talking that blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this? Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car, ah, ah
If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Boy, come on, give me rock stuff
Come put a little love it my glove bag
I wanna dance with no pants on
Meet me in the back with the jack and the jukebox

So cut to the chase kid
'Cause I know you don't care what my middle name is
I wanna be naked and you're wasted

Music's up, listen hot stuff
I'm in love with this song
So just hush, baby, shut up
Heard enough

Stop talk, talk, talking that blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this? Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car, ah, ah
If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

You be delaying, you're always saying some shit
You say I'm playing, I'm never laying the dick
Saying blah, blah, blah 'cause I don't care who you are in this bar
It only matters who I am

Stop talk, talk, talking that blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this? Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car, ah, ah
If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Blah, blah, blah
Think you'll be getting this? Nah, nah, nah
Not in the back of my car, ah, ah
If you keep talking that blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

Blah, blah, blah
Stop talking
Stop talk, talk talking that
