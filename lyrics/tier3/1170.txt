Ridin' in the drop top with the top down
Saw you switchin' lanes, girl
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right
Come here, let me get your name, girl

Tell me where you from, what you do, what you like
Let me pick your brain, girl
And tell me how they got that pretty little face
On that pretty little frame, girl

Well, let me show you 'round, let me take you out
Bet you we can have some fun, girl
'Cause we can do it fast, fast, slow
Whichever way you wanna run, girl

But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings
Do it how you want it done, girl
And who would've thought that you could be the one
'Cause I

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love
(L O V E)

Come over and lemme show you 'round
Let me take you out, bet you we can have some fun, girl
'Cause we can dress it up, we can dress it down
Any way you want it done, girl

Or we can stay home, talkin' on the phone
Rappin' 'til we see the sun, girl
Do what I gotta do, just gotta show you
That I'm the one, girl

Well, I'ma freak it right, each and every night
I know how to do it insane, girl
'Cause I can make it hot, make it stop
Make you wanna say my name, girl

Come on baby please 'cause I'm on my knees
Can't get you off my brain, girl
But who would've thought that you could be the one
'Cause I

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love
(L O V E)

'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love
(L O V E)

The summer's over for the both of us
But that doesn't mean we should give up on love
You're the one that I've been thinking of
And I knew the day I met you you'd be the one, oh!

I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love
(L O V E)

'Cause I can't wait to fall in love with you
You can't wait to fall in love with me
This just can't be summer love, you'll see
This just can't be summer love
(L O V E)
