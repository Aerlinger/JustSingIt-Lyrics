Usher, Lil' Jon, Ludacris

Yeah, man
Once again, it's on
(It's on)
You know we had to do it again, right?
We had to do it again, boy
Want you to sing to these ladies, man

A'ight, so I'm up first?
A'ight, lemme have it
Let's do it

Baby, how ya doin'? Hope that 'cha fine
Wanna know what you got in mind
And I'm, got me fiendin' like Jodeci, girl, I can't leave you alone
Take a shot of this here Petrone' and it's gon' be on

V.I.P. done got way too crowded
I'm about to end up callin' it a night
You should holla at 'cha girl
Tell her you shake it and seized

Pull off, beep-beep, shotgun in the GT with me
She said, "Oh, oh, I'm ready to ride, yeah
'Cause once you get inside, you can't change your mind
Don't mean to sound invasion but you gotta promise, baby, oh"

Tell me again
(Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Oh, I gotta know, baby, oh yeah)

Tell me again
(Make sho' you right, oh, before we leave)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Oh, it's a good look, baby)

Sometime wanna be your lover
Sometime wanna be your friend
Sometime wanna hug ya
Hold hands, slow-dance while the record spins

Opened up your heart 'cause you said
I made you feel so comfortable
Used to play back then
Now you all grown-up like Rudy Huxtable

I could be your buck, you could beat me up
Play-fight in the dark then we both make up
I'd do anything just to feel your butt
Why you got me so messed up?

I don't know but you gotta stop trippin'
Be a good girl, now, turn around
And get these whippings
You know you like it like that
You don't have to fight back

Here's a pillow, bite that
And I'll be settin' separate plays
So on all these separate days
Your legs can go the separate ways

Tell me again
(Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Oh, it's a good look, baby)

Tell me again
(Tell me over and over and over again)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Make sho' you right before you choose)

I's been know you fo' a long time
(Shawty)
But fuckin' never crossed my mind
(Shawty)

But tonight, I seen sumthin' in ya
(Shawty)
That made me wanna get wit 'cha
(Shawty)

But you ain't been nuttin' but a friend to me
(Shawty)
And a nigga never ever dreamed to be
(Shawty)

Up in here, kissin', huggin', squeezin', touchin'
(Shawty)
Up in the bathtub, rub a dubbin'
(Shawty)

Are you sure you wanna go this route?
(Shawty)
Let a nigga know before I pull it out
(Shawty)

I would never ever cross the line
(Shawty)
Shawty, let me hit ya to me
One mo' time, one mo' time

Tell me again
(Tell me again, my baby)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Oh, it's a good look, baby)

Tell me again
(Make sho' you right, oh, before we leave)
That we'll be lovers and friends
(Tell me over and over and over again)

Oh oh hoo, oh oh hoo
Oh oh hoo, oh yeah

Please tell your lovers and friends
That Usher, Jon and Luda had to do it again
(Hey, hey)
Please tell your lovers and friends
That Usher, Jon and Luda had to do it again that's right

(Hey, hey)
Please tell your lovers and friends
That Usher, Jon and Luda had to do it again
(Hey, hey)
