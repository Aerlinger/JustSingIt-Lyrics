We can go to the tropics, sip pia coladas
Shorty I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums where killas get hung
Shorty I could take you there

You know I could take ya, I could take ya
I could take ya, I could take ya, shorty I could take you there
You know I could take ya, I could take ya
I could take ya, I could take ya, shorty I could take you there

Baby girl, I know it's rough but come wit me
We can take a trip to the hood
It's no problem girl, it's my city
I could take you there

Little kid wit' guns, only 15
Roamin' the streets, up to no good
When gun shot, just watch us, run quickly
I could show you where

As long you're wit' me, baby you'll be alright
I'm known in the ghetto, girl just stay by my side
Or we can leave the slums go to paradise
Babe it's up to you, it's whatever you like

We can go to the tropics, sip pia coladas
Shorty I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums where killas get hung
Shorty I could take you there

You know I could take ya, I could take ya
I could take ya, I could take ya, shorty I could take you there
You know I could take ya, I could take ya
I could take ya, I could take ya, shorty I could take you there

Shorty come wit' me it's no worries
I know the bad men them where I stay
Police fly pursuit in a hurry
This is no gun play

Don't be scared I know the West Indies
It's Jamaica, that's where I'm from
Might see something you're not used to
Welcome to the slums

As long you're wit' me, baby you'll be alright
I'm known in the ghetto, girl just stay by my side
Or we can leave the slums go to paradise
Babe it's up to you, it's whatever you like

We can go to the tropics, sip pia coladas
Shorty I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums where killas get hung
Shorty I could take you there

You know I could take ya, I could take ya
I could take ya, I could take ya, shorty I could take you there
You know I could take ya, I could take ya
I could take ya, I could take ya, shorty I could take you there

Oh, we can go
To a place I know you gon' like
The beach, the breeze
West Indies, I call it paradise

We can go to the tropics, sip pia coladas
Shorty I could take you there
Or we can go to the slums where killas get hung
Shorty I could take you there

You know I could take ya, I could take ya
I could take ya, I could take ya, shorty I could take you there
You know I could take ya, I could take ya
I could take ya, I could take ya, shorty I could take you there
