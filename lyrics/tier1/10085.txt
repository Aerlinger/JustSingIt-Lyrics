You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, Ill be there
Ill reach out my hand to you
Ill have faith in all you do
Just call my name and Ill be there

And oh, Ill be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
Im so glad that I found you
Ill be there with a love thats strong
Ill be your strength, Ill keep holding on
Yes, I'll be, yes, I'll be

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, well thats all Im after
Whenever you need me, Ill be there
Ill be there to protect you, yeah baby
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name and Ill be there

And oh, Ill be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
Im so glad that I found you
Ill be there with a love thats strong
Ill be your strength, Ill keep holding on
Yes, I'll be, yes, I'll be

If you should ever find someone new
I know hed better be good to you
'Cause if he doesnt, Ill be there

Dont you know, baby, yeah, yeah?
Ill be there, Ill be there
Just call my name, Ill be there
Just look over your shoulders, honey

Ill be there, Ill be there
Whenever you need me, Ill be there
Dont you know, baby, yeah, yeah?
Ill be there, Ill be there
Just call my name, Ill be there

Ill be there, Ill be there
