She said, I don't know if I've ever been good enough
I'm a little bit rusty, and I think my head is caving in
And I don't know if I've ever really been loved
By the hand that's touched me, well I feel like something's gonna give
And I'm a little bit angry, well

This ain't over, no not here, not while I still need you around
You don't owe me, we might change
Yeah, we might just feel good

(Chorus)
I wanna push you around, well I will, well I will
I wanna push you down, well I will, well I will
I wanna take you for granted (2x)
Yeah, yeah I will, I will

She said I don't know why you would ever lie to me
Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is gonna hurt ya
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
You couldn't stand to be near me
When my face don't seem to want to shine cuz it's a little bit dirty well

Don't just stand there, say nice things to me
I've been cheated, I've been wronged, but you
You don't know me, I can't change
I won't do anything at all

(Chorus)

Oh but don't bowl me over
Just wait a minute, well it kinda fell apart, things get so
Crazy, crazy
Don't rush this baby (2x)

(Chorus)
