* 56 I saw the light on the night that I passed by her window* 49 I saw the flickering shadows of love on her blind0 16 She was my woman* 52 As she deceived me I watched and went out of my mind0 19 My, my, my, Delilah22 Why? Why? Why Delilah?0 40 I could see that girl was no good for me* 50 But I was lost like a slave that no man could free0 * 55 At break of day when that man drove away, I was waiting* 55 I cross the street to her house and she opened the door0 24 She stood there laughing* 51 I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more0 18 My, my, my Delilah22 Why? Why? Why Delilah?0 * 42 So before they come to break down the door* 49 Forgive me Delilah, I just couldn't take any more0 24 She stood there laughing* 51 I felt the knife in my hand and she laughed no more0 19 My, my, my, Delilah22 Why? Why? Why Delilah?0 * 42 So before they come to break down the door* 49 Forgive me Delilah, I just couldn't take any more* 49 Forgive me Delilah, I just couldn't take any more0 11 Songwriters12 PORTER, COLE0 12 Published by* 145 Lyrics Â© Warner/Chappell Music, Inc., Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, EMI Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group, Peermusic Publishing0 0 0 * 51 Read more: Tom Jones - Delilah Lyrics | MetroLyrics
