We dug these holes we crawled into
Now they're my home
Now here I cannot feel the wind
Can't feel the rain or cold

And I believe in gentle harmony
How I loathe all this obscenity
Is the way my life's got to be
By a single opportunity

Look at me, oh look at me
Is this the way I've always been, oh no, oh no
Now I'm dreaming somebody
Would simply come and kidnap me, oh no, oh no

Everyday I lie awake and pray to God
Today's the day, oh no, oh no
Here I am, oh here I am
When will someone understand, oh no, oh no

And all at once I feel this
Oh, how it clings to me
It reels and calls me towards a
Confounding destiny

And I can feel the magnets pinch my hands
The more I run, the more I am convinced
[Incomprehensible]
Just like we settle in the foggy mist

Look at me, oh look at me
Is this the way I've always been, oh no, oh no
Now I'm dreaming somebody
Would simply come and kidnap me, oh no, oh no

Everyday I lie awake and pray to God
Today's the day, oh no, oh no
Here I am, here I am
When will someone understand, oh no, oh no

Look at me, oh look at me
Is this the way I've always been, oh no, oh no
Now I'm dreaming somebody
Would simply come and kidnap me, oh no, oh no

Everyday I lie awake and pray to God
Today's the day, oh no, oh no
Here I am, here I am
When will someone understand, oh no, oh no
