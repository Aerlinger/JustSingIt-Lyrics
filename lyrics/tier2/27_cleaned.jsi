Clap for a nigga with his rapping @#$%
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping @#$%

Riding clean fix your head, in my crown

Flush out a Riesling, when's Hov's out, them hoes out
Y'all put y'all weaves in and

Clap for a nigga with his rapping @#$%
Blow a stack for your niggas with your trapping @#$%
Spent all my euros on tuxes and weird clothes I party with weirdos

Numbers don't lie check the scoreboard

Numbers don't lie check the scoreboard
