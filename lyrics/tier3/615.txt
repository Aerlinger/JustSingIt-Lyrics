I've had the same jeans on for four days now
Im gonna go to a disco in the middle of the town
Everybodys dressing up, Im dressing down

Lifes one big circle, and it doesn't end
When it ends will you still be my friend?
Im not making a fool of myself
I said, Im not making a fool of myself

So when you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you someone that you dont know
Oh don't that shit make your head spin around?
So get yourself together, yeah
Get your feet back on the ground

I've had the same jeans on for four days now
Im gonna go to a disco in the middle of the town
Everybodys dressing up, Im dressing down

I take my hat off to the busker man
When he's drowned all his sorrows in singing songs
Not everything has worked out to plan
But believe me hes smiling as long as he can

So when you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you someone that you dont know
Oh don't that shit make your head spin around?
So get yourself together, yeah
Get your feet back on the ground

I've had the same jeans on for four days now
Im gonna go to a disco in the middle of the town
Everybodys dressing up, Im dressing down

My mind's not perfect but its sincere
Youd be amazed at what you can achieve in a year
And you tried so hard but your heart's on a switch
And I know you tried so hard but your heart's on a switch

So when you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you someone that you dont know
Oh don't that shit make your head spin around?
So get yourself together, yeah
Get your feet back on the ground

So when you look in the mirror
Reflecting back at you someone that you dont know
Oh don't that shit make your head spin around?
So get yourself together, yeah
Get your feet back on the ground

Same jeans on for four days now
Everybodys dressing up, Im dressing down
Im not making a fool of myself
So believe me baby I can tell

Same jeans on for four days now
Everybodys dressing up, Im dressing down
Im not making a fool of myself
Believe me baby I can tell
