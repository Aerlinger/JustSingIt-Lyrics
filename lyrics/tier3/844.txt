You make my world, you make my world go 'round
You turn me up, you turn me upside down
You make my world, you make my world go 'round
You get me off, you get me off the ground

You pick me up when I fall.... down
You pick me up when I fall.... down

Girl, you're like an elevator cause you always pick me up
Girl, you're like a doctor when I'm sick you always stitch me up
You can be my DJ, I'm your record, come on mix me up
You can be my lollipop, lemme, lemme lick you up

On the bottom, on the top, baby, lemme flip you up
You can be my soda pop, Coca Cola sip it up
Whip cream, whip it up, strip on, zip it up
I could be your chip, you can be my dip, lemme dip it up

You make my world, you make my world go 'round
You turn me up, you turn me upside down
You make my world, you make my world go 'round
You get me off, you get me off the ground

You pick me up when I fall.... down
You pick me up when I fall.... down
You pick me up when I fall.... down
You pick me up when I fall.... down

Boy, you're like an elevator cause you always pick me up
Boy, you're like my doctor, when I'm sick, you always stitch me up
You could be my DJ, I'm your record come on mix me up
Boy, just be my lollipop, lemme, lemme lick you up

Always on my membrane, I love you so I give it up
Lets visit all the places that's exquisite let's go live it up
Walking down lover's lane, flying in an airplane
Boy you get me higher, like your nickname was Mary Jane

You make my world, you make my world go round
You turn me up, you turn me upside down
You make my world, you make my world go round
You get me off, you get me off the ground

You pick me up when I fall.... down
You pick me up when I fall.... down
You pick me up when I fall.... down
You pick me up when I fall.... down

Fall down
You pick me up when I fall.... down
You pick me up when I fall.... down
You pick me off the ground
When I'm down, down, down...
