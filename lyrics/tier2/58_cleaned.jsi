[Verse 1]
I know you don't get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
Here take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe off all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

[Hook]
Lose yourself to dance

[Verse 2]
I know you don't get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
Here take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe off all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Everybody dancing on the floor
Can't do any more anymore
Everybody on the floor
Yeah, come on

[Verse 3]
I know you don't get chance to take a break this often
I know your life is speeding and it isn't stopping
Here take my shirt and just go ahead and wipe off all the
Sweat, sweat, sweat

[Hook]

[Bridge]
