[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day

Uh, Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone, gone
Til I'm gone, gone
Til I'm gone, gone

[Tinie Tempah - verse 1]
I buy time in Switzerland
I drive round in Monaco
I shook hands with Royalty
I make songs that monarchs know
Ti Ti Ti La So Fa
Mi Mi Mi, MI Re Do
Call me Aloe Blacc cause I Need That Dollar yo
ha ha
Hic-hic-hiccup
Blame it on the liquor
I came through like a stick up
Now I'm ballin' like a kick up
I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of Nip Tuck
And yes I am the best man, I'm so sorry bout the mix up

Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill
You know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day

Uh, Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone, gone
Til I'm gone, gone
Til I'm gone
But I wont be gone for too long

[Tinie Tempah - verse 2]
In Amsterdam, haha, Ammerland
Just came from Aussie tour
You've never seen this Singapore
I'm the one like 2 plus 3
M-M-M-Minus four
Fe-fe-fe-fi-fo-fum
Everytime I can stalk
Yeh, yeh, I'm honest I landed in a rocket
With a crown inside my watch and silver B sign on my bonnet
You don't need a thermometer to tell you who's the hottest
Ip dip do muthaf-cker you are not it

Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill
You know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day

Uh, Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone, gone
Til I'm gone, gone
Til I'm gone, gone
baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone, gone
Til I'm gone, gone
Til I'm gone
But I wont be gone for too long

[Tinie Tempah - Bridge]
Ok I'm in it, I'm in it to the finish
I keep them bottles coming like my card aint got no limit
Got some friends that playing football
And some friends that playing cricket
And a mistress that is fine like a f-cking parking ticket
Haha
I said I'm in it, I'm in it til the finish
I keep them bottles coming til there aint nothing in it
I'm like Mario on mushrooms
I'm like Popeye on some spinach
We gon keep it coming till I no speaka no english
Ahh

[Wiz Khalifa - Chorus]
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day

Uh, Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone, gone
Til I'm gone, gone
Til I'm gone
But I wont be gone for too long
But I wont be gone for too long
But I wont be gone for too long
