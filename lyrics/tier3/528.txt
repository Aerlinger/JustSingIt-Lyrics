It's about to be a girlfight
Remix, hey, sendin' this out to all the ladies
That got beef with another ***
Just walk up to that *** and tell her, whatcha tell her?

I don't fight, I don't argue
I just hit that chick with a bottle
I don't fight, I don't argue
I just hit that chick with a bottle
(It's about to be a [Incomprehensible] girlfight)

We 'bout to throw them bows
We 'bout to swing them thangs
We 'bout to throw them bows
We 'bout to swing them thangs
It's about to be a what? Girlfight

I hit that chick wit a bottle, I hit her full throttle
Didn't think I could do it 'cause I look like a model
I'm so impossible, originated for girlfights
The first to leave a heffa in the hospital

That's me, yup, M.S.B.
Ms. Bottle Action, I swear you heffas can't see me
Y'all can't never take me an' insinuate me
Turn around an' bite me an' try to demonstrate me

Huh? How 'bout I slap ya an' hit ya with one of these
Punch ya homie in the mouth with a handful of rings
Don't need no help, I can do it myself
Had a clique full of girls, now you all by yourself

You all alone, you ain't said one word
Think security gonna stop it? I'll just flip them a bird
What? You got a beef, baby, I tell ya, we can cook it
Put ya dukes up, b***, you wanna fight? We can do it

We 'bout to throw them bows
We 'bout to swing them thangs
We 'bout to throw them bows
We 'bout to swing them thangs
It's about to be a what? Girlfight

Slit ya throat to the meat, *** if you got beef
An' that's food for thought, so my pits' can eat
If I gotta fight the girl, I'm snatchin' out her curls
I'ma catch that *** around the corner, beat her tushy Earl

An' let her world caved in, just like her face
Nobody know I done it 'cause I left no trace
I'm a bad mothaf***, Chi town, my home base
Brooke, diggin' in yo a***, Happy Valentines Day

Do what I say, lay, lay, lay, my knuckles on ya jaw
You won't never get a witness sayin' what they saw
I ain't tryin' to be no victim, you wanna cross that line?
I leave a b*** leakin' blood, like it's *** time

Got that old school in me like Tampax
You can't leave home without my CD, like Air Max
I throw them bows left to right
I'm so so Def a like, legendary like Mike, ***

We 'bout to throw them bows
We 'bout to swing them thangs
We 'bout to throw them bows
We 'bout to swing them thangs
It's about to be a what? Girlfight

Look, if you really wanna get it poppin'
I can act like I ain't got a album droppin'
But, you the type to talk slick, quick
Get ya a*** whipped an' then go call the cops

[Incomprehensible] in the process of gettin' it started
File all types of reports, sayin' you got robbed
Now that ain't gangsta an' you ain't gangsta
Matter 'fact, your whole low fake crew is wankstas

I'm tellin' you, you don't really want it with me
I don't know how to act, Remy'll O.D.
I be camped out, waitin' at ya J O B
Wit my hair in two braids, face vaseline

An' my squad know the plan before we start thumpin'
Even if I'm winnin', we call gon' jump in
Talkin' wreckless, no hired protection
An' we still walkin' 'round them metal detectors

We 'bout to throw them bows
We 'bout to swing them thangs
We 'bout to throw them bows
We 'bout to swing them thangs
It's about to be a what? Girlfight

I'm poppin' one heffa, two heffas, three heffas, four
If that chick with her, watch her watch her hit the flo'
I don't fight, I don't argue
Yeah, I just hit that chick with a bottle
