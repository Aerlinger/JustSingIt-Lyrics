"I'm here for you," she said
And we can stay for a while
My boyfriend's gone
We can just pretend

Lips that need no introduction
Now who's the greater sin?
Your drab eyes seem to invite
Tell me darling where do we begin?

Was this over before?
Before it ever began?
Your kiss, your calls, your crutch
Like the Devil's got your hand

This was over before
Before it ever began
Your lips, your lies, your lust
Like the Devil's in your hands

Everyone in this town
Is seeing somebody else
Everybody's tired of someone
Our eyes wander for help

Prayers that need no answer now
I'm tired of who I am
You were my greatest mistake
I fell in love with your sin, your littlest sin

Was this over before?
Before it ever began?
Your kiss, your calls, your crutch
Like the Devil's got your hand

This was over before
Before it ever began
Your lips, your lies, your lust
Like the Devil's in your hands

Failure is your disease
You want my outline drawn
You were my greatest failure
Discourse your saving song

Was this over before?
Before it ever began?
Your kiss, your calls, your crutch
Like the Devil's got your hand

This was over before
Before it ever began
Your lips, your lies, your lust
Like the Devil's in your hands

Was this over before?
Before it ever began?
Your kiss, your calls, your crutch
Like the Devil's got your hand

This was over before
Before it ever began
Your lips, your lies, your lust
Like the Devil's in your hands
