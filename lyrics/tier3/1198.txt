Go ahead lil' mama, I can transform ya
No, I can't dance but I can dance on ya
Swizz on the beat, Chris move your feet
And baby, I can transform your him to a me

I can change your life, make it so new
Make you never want to go back to the old you
Ciroc and lime, give it lil' time
And she gonna transform like Optimus Prime

Need a ride, I can Range you up, money, I can change you up
You can have your own, no longer be the passenger
Swag low, I build you up, knees, we can stand you up
Red lips, red dress, like 'em like a fire truck

What you need, you can have that
My Black Card, they don't decline that
See potential in ya, let me mold that
I can transform ya, I can transform ya

I can transform ya, I can, I can transform ya
Anything ya want, I can, I can get it for ya
You're my baby girl, so you know I get it for ya
I can trans, I can trans, I can transform ya

Shoes you got it, got it, bags, you got it, got it
Cars, you got it, got it, m-money, you got it, got it
I can, I can transform ya, I can, I can transform ya
Anything you want I can, I can get it for ya

See it in a video, you can have it really though
Iced out everything, frigid like an Eskimo
Wanna fly? We can go anywhere you wanna go
Jimmy Choo's in Italy, Louis V in Tokyo

Something like Pinocchio, if you lie down I'mma grow
Wanna see me do it big, I can show you how it goes
Take you from an amateur to being professional
I can have you swag surfing

What you need, you can have that
My Black Card, they don't decline that
See potential in ya, let me mold that
I can transform ya, I can transform ya

I can transform ya, I can, I can transform ya
Anything ya want, I can, I can get it for ya
You're my baby girl, so you know I get it for ya
I can trans, I can trans, I can transform ya

Shoes you got it, got it, bags, you got it, got it
Cars, you got it, got it, m-money, you got it, got it
I can, I can transform ya, I can, I can transform ya
Anything you want I can, I can get it for ya

Ok, I can transform ya like a Transformer
I can turn you from a human to a Carter
Take you off the bench, turn ya to a starter
Then take you home and put you on a charger

Then my car transforms to a charter
And we can fly to wherever you ever thought of
I take you to where it's warmer
Then I gotta rip off your dress like a warm up

But I'm just getting warmed up
So tell your man he better get his Voltron up
I transform her to a Ducati
Then I transform me to a Bugatti

'Cause her form puts me in a trance
I transform smaller and she puts me in her pants
Swizz-Swizz on the beat, Chris move ya feet
And Weezy transform a good girl to a freak

I can transform ya, I can, I can transform ya
Anything ya want, I can, I can get it for ya
You're my baby girl, so you know I did it for ya
I can trans, I can trans, I can transform ya

Shoes you got it, got it, bags, you got it, got it
Cars, you got it, got it, m-money, you got it, got it
I can, I can transform ya, I can, I can transform ya
Anything you want I can, I can get it for ya
