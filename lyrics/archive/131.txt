	<li><p>For a second you were here</p></li>
	<li><p>Now you over there</p></li>
	<li><p>It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body</p></li>
	<li><p>Like you never had a love</p></li>
	<li><p>Never had a love</p></li>
	<li><p>When you was just a youngin' your looks were so precious</p></li>
	<li><p>But now your grown up</p></li>
	<li><p>So fly it's like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for five seconds</p></li>
	<li><p>Without you being insecure</p></li>
	<li><p>You never credit yourself, so when you got older</p></li>
	<li><p>It's seems like you came back ten times over</p></li>
	<li><p>Now you're sitting here in this damn corner</p></li>
	<li><p>Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulders</p></li>
	<li><p>See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart</p></li>

	<li><p>Like you never had a love</p></li>
	<li><p>Had a love</p></li>
	<li><p>Oh, you had a lot of dreams that transformed to visions</p></li>
	<li><p>The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions</p></li>
	<li><p>But it wasn't your fault</p></li>
	<li><p>Wasn't in your intentions</p></li>
	<li><p>To be the one here talking to me</p></li>
	<li><p>Be the one listenin'</p></li>
	<li><p>But I admire your popping bottles and dippin'</p></li>
	<li><p>Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping</p></li>
	<li><p>Baby, so don't be mad</p></li>
	<li><p>Nobody else tripping</p></li>
