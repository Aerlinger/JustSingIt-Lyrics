Ooh baby, baby, baby

Papa comin' over to give you that raw
Favorite position is from the back door
Girl, you know the drill, don't ask no questions
You already know

Tonight's the night, girl
(Yes)
I'm tryin' to give you that thing to make you say
(Yes)
From the kitchen floor down to the fireplace
(Yes)
Incense burning, your body talkin' that shit to me
(Yes)

Cancel that phone, the only sound I'm tryin' to hear is your moan
(Yes)
You ride topless, no panties on
(Yes)
And I've been thinkin' 'bout this all day long
You're giving me the fire dome

Papa comin' over to give you that raw
Favorite position is from the back door
Girl, you know the drill, don't ask no questions
You already know

Papa comin' over to give you that raw
Favorite position is from the back door
Girl, you know the drill, don't ask no questions
You already know

Is your girl, Janae, home?
(Yes)
Call her up and tell her it's 'bout to be on
(Yes)
Tell her don't show, if it ain't heels and thongs
(Yes)
I can already see it, ooh what a feeling

Just don't, get jealous if I hit that too hard
(Yes)
You come first, you know you're my heart
(Yes)
'Cuz it'll always be yours, girl, I'm 'bout to turn you out

Papa comin' over to give you that raw
Favorite position is from the back door
Girl, you know the drill, don't ask no questions
You already know

Papa comin' over to give you that raw
Favorite position is from the back door
Girl, you know the drill, don't ask no questions
You already know

You know just how I like to see it
(You know just how I like to see it)
You know just how I like to beat it
You already know

You know I like to go down and eat it
(I love it when you go down and eat it)
And you know I won't stop until you get it
You already know

Papa comin' over to give you that raw
Favorite position is from the back door
Girl, you know the drill, don't ask no questions
You already know

Papa comin' over to give you that raw
Favorite position is from the back door
Girl, you know the drill, don't ask no questions
You already know

Papa comin' over to give you that raw
Favorite position is from the back door
Girl, you know the drill, don't ask no questions
You already know

Papa comin' over to give you that raw
Favorite position is from the back door
Girl, you know the drill, don't ask no questions
You already know
