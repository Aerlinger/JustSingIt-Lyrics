How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

She could go lower than I ever really thought she could
Face down, ass up
The top of your booty jiggling out your jeans
Baby, pull your pants up

I like it when I see you do it
Better than I've ever seen it done before
A lot of women drop it to the ground
But how low can you go?

Lower than your mama's
Ever seen it in her lifetime
Never would've imagined
Did not even in her right mind

Practice in front of that mirror
Now you doing it on the dance floor
Mad 'cause I can't get with ya
To just show me how to dance

I may not wanna get low
So I post it up kinda like a playa do
But if you come to the crib
Then I might show you girls a thang or two

Yeah, I think you a superstar
With a ass like that, you gotta blow
Before you make it big
There's just one thing I gotta know

How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

I could go low, go low, lower than you know
Go low, go low, l-l-lower than you know
Go low, go low, l-l-lower than you know
Go low, go low, l-l-lower than you know

I be like knick-knack patty-whack
Oh, where my kitty cat? Give a dog a bone
How many licks does it takes 'til get to the center
And let a realer nigga take you home?

I could make this show stop
Soon as you hear this flow pop
From A-T-L-A-N-T-A
All the way down to your drop

Put the needle on a record
And I'll make her get lower than a Lamborghini
And if she really getting low
Then I'mma shoot a video and put it all on TV

'Cause I like that French vanilla
And the caramel
But when it comes to chocolate
I know that very well

Asian persuasion, no discrimination
I love how they seem to please us
I wanna taste them butterican pecan
Peanut buttercups like reeses pieces

'Cause I think you a superstar
With a ass like that, you gotta blow
Before you make it big
Well, there's just one thing I gotta know

How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

I could go low, go low, lower than you know
Go low, go low, l-l-lower than you know
Go low, go low, l-l-lower than you know
Go low, go low, l-l-lower than you know

Drop it, hit it, dump it, split it
Don't stop, get it, get it
Put it in reverse just to rack it up
Let me put some Luda in it

Show me what you workin' with
I'll show you some of this bank roll
Yeah, you a superstar
There's just one thing I gotta know, so

How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?
How low can you go? How low can you go?

I could go low, go low, lower than you know
Go low, go low, l-l-lower than you know
Go low, go low, l-l-lower than you know
Go low, go low, l-l-lower than you know
