38 When I was younger, I saw my daddy cry21 And curse at the wind36 He broke his own heart and I watched28 As he tried to reassemble it0 23 And my momma swore that34 She would never let herself forget36 And that was the day that I promised* 43 I'd never sing of love if it does not exist0 39 But darling, you are the only exception26 You are the only exception26 You are the only exception26 You are the only exception0 39 Maybe I know, somewhere deep in my soul21 That love never lasts* 49 And we've got to find other ways to make it alone23 Or keep a straight face0 31 And I've always lived like this30 Keeping a comfortable distance* 72 And up until now I had sworn to my self that I'm content with loneliness* 42 Because none of it was ever worth the risk0 30 But you are the only exception26 You are the only exception26 You are the only exception26 You are the only exception0 32 I've got a tight grip on reality* 48 But I can't let go of what's in front of me here* 53 I know you're leaving in the morning when you wake up* 54 Leave me with some kind of proof, it's not a dream, oh0 26 You are the only exception26 You are the only exception26 You are the only exception26 You are the only exception0 26 You are the only exception26 You are the only exception26 You are the only exception26 You are the only exception0 30 And I'm on my way to believing34 Oh, and I'm on my way to believing0 11 Songwriters* 43 WILLIAMS, HAYLEY NICHOLE/FARRO, JOSHUA NEIL0 12 Published by36 Lyrics Â© Warner/Chappell Music, Inc.0 0 0 * 61 Read more: Paramore - The Only Exception Lyrics | MetroLyrics
