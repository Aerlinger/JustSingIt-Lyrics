When the lala hits ya lyrics just splits ya
Head so hard, that ya hat can't fit ya
Either I'm witcha or against ya
Format venture, back through that maze I sent ya

Talkin' to the rap inventor
***** wit the game tight, Bic that flame right
Spell my name right, B I, double G, I E
Iced out lights out, me and Cease a Leo

Gettin' head from some chick he know
See it's all about the Cheddar, nobody do it better
Going back to Cali, strictly for the weather
Women, and the ****, sticky green

No seeds ***** please, Poppa ain't soft
Dead up in the Hood, ain't no love lost
Got me mixed up, you drunk them licks up
Mad 'cause I got my **** ******

And my ***** ******, forfeit, the game is mine
I'ma spell my name one more time, check it
Its the, N O, T O, R I, O
U S, you just, lay down, slow

Recognize a real Don when you see one
Sippin' on booze in the house of blues

I'm going, going, back, back, to Cali, Cali
I'm going, going, back, back, to Cali, Cali
I'm going, going, back, back, to Cali, Cali
I'm going, going, back, back, to Cali, Cali

If I got to choose a coast I got to choose the East
I live out there, so don't go there
But that don't mean a ***** can't rest in the West
See some nice ******* in the West

Smoke some nice sess in the West, y'all ****** is a mess
Thinkin' I'm gon' stop, givin' L.A. props
All I got is beef with those that violate me
I shall annihilate thee

Case closed, suitcase filled with clothes
Linens and things, I begin' things
People start to flash, 818's, 213's
313's, B.I.G.

Frequently floss **** at Roscoe's
If I wanna ****** her, take her to Fat burger
Spend about a week on Venice Beach
Sippin' Cristal, with some freaks from 'Frisco

I'm going, going, back, back, to Cali, Cali
I'm going, going, back, back, to Cali, Cali
I'm going, going, back, back, to Cali, Cali
I'm going, going, back, back, to Cali, Cali

Cali got *******, models on the runway
Scream biggie, biggie, gimme one more chance
I be whippin' on the freeway, the NYC way
On the celly, celly with my homeboy Lance

Pass hash from left to right
Only got five ****** left to light, I'm set tonight
Paid a visit to Versace stores
Bet she suck until I ain't got no more, only in L.A.

Bust on ******* belly, rub it in they tummy
Lick it, say it's yummy, then **** yo' man
What's your plan, is it to rock the Tri State?
Almost gold, 5 G's at show gate
Or do you wanna see about seven digits
**** hoe's exquisite, Cali, great place to visit

I'm going, going, back, back, to Cali, Cali
I'm going, going, back, back, to Cali, Cali
I'm going, going, back, back, to Cali, Cali
