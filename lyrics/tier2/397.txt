A 2 step, a 2 step

Now gon an 2 step, now gon an 2 step
Now gon an 2 step, now gon an 2 step
Now get jiggy wit it, now get jiggy wit it
Now get jiggy wit it, now get jiggy wit it

Now gon an 2 step, ay watch me 2 step
Now can you 2 step like I 2 step?
Watch me get jiggy wit it, watch me get jiggy wit it
Watch me get jiggy wit it, watch me get jiggy wit it
Gon an 2 step!

I hit the club fresh my stunna shades on
2 steppin gettin' jiggy wit my J's on
Dont get yo' steps wrong dont try to bite mine
2 steppin, yeah Im back, Unk one mo' time

See we gon form a line and we gon step it right
Now step it to the left, girl you know you dynamite
Now have some good times, I see you got it right
Beat my wrist ice colder than a Bud Light

Now Ima take my time, where the gangstas at?
And you can still post the wall, ***** holla back
Grey Goose and yak, ***** filled wit kush
Im getting jiggy wit it smokin on that George Bush
Step!

Now gon an 2 step, now gon an 2 step
Now get jiggy wit it, now get jiggy wit it

Watch me get jiggy wit it, watch me get jiggy wit it
Watch me get jiggy wit it, watch me get jiggy wit it

Now bring it back, bring it back
Hey I made y'all walk it out
Everybody 2 steppin now we finna turn it out

Now here we go again, you already slow
If you aint 2 steppin get your sh**and hit the do'

I see you baby girl sweatin' out your lil perm

They call me Big Worm, where my money at?
2 steppin wit my stacks ***** holla back
The O.C. is back y'all best to deal wit it
And dont be steppin on my shoes when I get jiggy wit it

Now gon an 2 step, now gon an 2 step
Now gon an 2 step, now gon an 2 step
Now get jiggy wit it, now get jiggy wit it
Now get jiggy wit it, now get jiggy wit it

Now gon an 2 step, ay watch me 2 step
Now can you 2 step like I 2 step?
Watch me get jiggy wit it, watch me get jiggy wit it
Watch me get jiggy wit it, watch me get jiggy wit it
Gon an 2 step!

A 2 step, a 2 step
A 2 step, a 2 step
A 2 step, a 2 step
Gon' an' 2 step!
