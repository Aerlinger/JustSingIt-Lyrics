I, I gotta new life, you would hardly recognize me, I'm so glad
How could a person like me care for you?
I, why do I bother when you're not the one for me?
It's enough, enough

I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong?

I, under the clear moon for so many years
I've wondered who you are
How could a person like you bring me joy?
Under the pale moon where I see a lot of stars
It's enough, enough

I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
Life is demanding without understanding
I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong
But where do you belong? Oh oh oh

I saw the sign and it opened up my mind
And I am happy now living without you, I've left you, oh oh oh

I saw the sign and it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
No one's gonna drag you up to get into the light where you belong

I saw the sign, I saw the sign
I saw the sign
I saw the sign, I saw the sign
I saw the sign, I saw the sign
I saw the sign
And it opened up my eyes, I saw the sign
