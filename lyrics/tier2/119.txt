This one is for the boys with the boomin' system
Top down, AC with the coolin' system
When he come up in the club, he be blazin' up
Got stacks on deck like he savin' up

And he ill, he real, he might got a deal
He pop bottles and he got the right kind of bill
He cold, he dope, he might sell coke
He always in the air, but he never fly coach

He a muthafuckin trip, trip, sailor of the ship, ship
When he make it drip, drip kiss him on the lip, lip
That's the kind of dude I was lookin' for
And yes you'll get slapped if you're lookin' ho

I said, excuse me you're a hell of a guy
I mean my, my, my, my you're like pelican fly
I mean, you're so shy and I'm loving your tie
You're like slicker than the guy with the thing on his eye, oh

Yes I did, yes I did
Somebody please tell him who the eff I is
I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up
Back coupes up, and chuck the deuce up

Boy you got my heartbeat runnin' away
Beating like a drum and it's coming your way
Can't you hear that boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass?

He got that super bass
Boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass
Yeah that's that super bass

Boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom, he got that super bass
Boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom, yeah that's that super bass

This one is for the boys in the Polos
Entrepreneur niggas in the moguls
He could ball with the crew, he could solo
But I think I like him better when he dolo

And I think I like him better with the fitted cap on
He ain't even gotta try to put the mac on
He just gotta give me that look, when he give me that look
Then the panties comin' off, off, unh

Excuse me, you're a hell of a guy
You know I really got a thing for American guys
I mean, sigh, sickenin' eyes
I can tell that you're in touch with your feminine side, oh

Yes I did, yes I did
Somebody please tell him who the eff I is
I am Nicki Minaj, I mack them dudes up
Back coupes up, and chuck the deuce up

Boy you got my heartbeat runnin' away
Beating like a drum and it's coming your way
Can't you hear that boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass?

He got that super bass
Boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass
Yeah that's that super bass

Boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom, he got that super bass
Boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom, yeah that's that super bass

See I need you in my life for me to stay
No, no, no, no, no I know you'll stay
No, no, no, no, no don't go away

Boy you got my heartbeat runnin' away
Don't you hear that heartbeat comin' your way?
Oh it be like, boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass
Can't you hear that boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass?

Boy you got my heartbeat runnin' away
Beating like a drum and it's coming your way
Can't you hear that boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass?

He got that super bass
Boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom bass
Yeah that's that super bass

Boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom, he got that super bass
Boom, badoom, boom
Boom, badoom, boom, yeah that's that super bass
