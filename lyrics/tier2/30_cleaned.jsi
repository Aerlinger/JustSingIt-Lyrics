Let 'em know that we're still rock n roll

I don't care about my make-up
I like it better with my jeans all ripped up
Don't know how to keep my mouth shut
You say, "So what?" (What)

I don't care if I'm a misfit
I like it better than the hipster @#$%
I am the @#$%' princess
You still love it

Some some how, it's a little different when, I'm with you
You know what I really am, all about
You know how it really goes, oh oh oh oh yeah
Some some way,
We'll be getting out of this, town one day
You're the only one that I, want with me
You know how the story goes, oh oh oh

When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I
Just put up, a middle finger to the sky
Let them know that we're still rock 'n roll

Rock 'n roll, hey hey hey
Rock 'n roll, hey hey hey

Call it a bad attitude dude
I'm never gonna to cover up that tattoo
I might have a couple issues
You say, "Me too" (yeah)
Don't care about a reputation
Must be living in the wrong generation
This is your invitation
Let's get wasted

Some some how, it's a little different when, I'm with you
You know what I really am, all about
You know how the story goes, oh oh oh

When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio
What if you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky
Let them know that we're still rock 'n roll

Rock 'n roll, hey hey hey
Rock 'n roll, hey hey hey (Rock 'n roll)

(Yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah)

When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio

What if you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky
Let them know that we're still rock 'n roll

When it's you and me
We don't need no one to tell us who to be
We'll keep turning up the radio

What if you and I
Just put up a middle finger to the sky
Let them know that we're still rock 'n roll

Rock 'n roll, hey hey hey
Rock 'n roll, hey hey hey
