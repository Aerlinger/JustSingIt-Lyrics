If you leave, don't leave now
Please don't take my heart away
Promise me just one more night
Then we'll go our separate ways

We always had time on our side
But now it's fading fast
Every second, every moment
We've gotta, we've gotta make it last

I touch you once I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I needed you then
You always said, "We'd still be friends someday"

If you leave I won't cry
I won't waste single day
But if you leave, no don't look back
I'll be running the other way

Seven years went under the bridge
Like time was standing still
Heaven knows what happens now
You've gotta, you've gotta say you will

I touch you once, I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I needed you then
You always said, "We'd still be friends someday, someday"

I touch you once, I touch you twice
I won't let go at any price
I need you now like I needed you then
You always said, "We'd still be friends someday"

Oh, if you leave
Oh, if you leave
Oh, if you leave
Oh, if you leave
Please don't leave
