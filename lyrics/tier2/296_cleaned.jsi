Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

I see you move, I'm checking your smile
Working your back like it's going out of style
Shake just a little bit faster
Shake just a little now girl

Dying to meet you, so let's mess around
I've got an obsession of us getting down
Come just a little bit closer
I just need permission so

Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

We can go all night
Give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

I want your green, green light
But if it's what it seems like
The way you moving baby
Lets me know that it's gonna be right

I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

I want your green redlight
I wanna see what you dance like
But if I can be your buddy
Help you study and get your head right

I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

Do I have a girlfriend? Technically no
If you'll be my girlfriend then I'll make it so
You'll be my only true lover
No competition, no others

Baby it's just the thrill of the chase
But I've got a feeling that I'm winning this race!
Baby I'm getting much closer
I just need permission so

Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

We can go all night
Give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

I want your green, green light
But if it's what it seems like
The way you moving baby
Lets me know that it's gonna be right

I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

I want your green redlight
I wanna see what you dance like
But if I can be your buddy
Help you study and get your head right

I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

So I went hard like Medusa staring at me
I told her let's go, let's blow this lame nigga factory
She said, What kind of girl do you think that I are?
The kind that you meet in a bar?
You think you can get whatever you want cause you some kinda star?

No I'm a comet
I just want you woman
Hey, if I were you then It would be me that I go home with
3, the one and only
One thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl "ooo he can get it"
Admit it

You did it
Let's hop a cab and split it
I'm kiddin
We both going to where you livin
Ha, I got you gigglin like I'm piglet
Oh that's the ticket?
I hope you are more like Anita Baker than Robin Givens

No, I don't know that lady, so let me quit it
I'm just style freein, freestylin which yall seldom do
This is what I'm telling you
Til the bed Im there you
Like I've been in jail for two
Years and then they let me loose

Give me the green light
Give me just one night
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now

We can go all night
Give me the green light
I'm ready to go right now
I'm ready to go right now
