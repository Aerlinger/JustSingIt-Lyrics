Rubbin' on that Italian leather
Konvict Jeans on
you ready?
Yeah!

Chorus:
I get it in 'til the sun rise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Aye! Aye! Aye!, I'm so paid

Number one hustla gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustla don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid

Verse 1:
I see police on that crooked, I
Doin' 100 on Interstate 95
My shorty leanin', blastin' that 'Do Or Die'
Wishin' that a motherfucker would, 'cause we certified

Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hope they never call off
I'm a sniper sittin' on the roof, already saw y'all

Ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I'd rather have them dollar bills rain on me
Than to let them haters come and make a name off me

Chorus:
That's why I get it in 'til the sun rise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Aye! Aye! Aye!, I'm so paid

Number one hustla gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustla don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid

Verse 2:
She said "Young, why your voice so hoarse?"
I just sound like money
Baby, I should'a been a Porsche
Paid like a, like a sugar free Red Bull
I'm so Paid
You know I keep a pocket full (Ha Ha!)
And that's before the taxes
Took my own gross net and hid it under my mattress (Damn!)
I use to get bored
Count 20's for practice
Paper therapy, we let the money relax us
Gold chains 'round my neck
Just like Michael Phelps
I made a killin' in the water
Kill em' in the water
Against all odds and I will stop
They try and keep me on the bottom, but I prefer the top
And my project chick, I moved her next to Joc
She said "the house too small"
I moved an extra block
So baby get your ass up
I need an extra block
I told her "Do the speed limit and no extra stops"
And that's why

Chorus:
I get it in 'till the sunrise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down, screamin' "Ah!"
Aye! Aye! Aye! I'm so paid

Number one hustla gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustla don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid

Verse 3:
I'm the boss, it only takes one call
For a driver to hit you up and drop you off and that's all
Guess what? I won't be takin' that fall
Homie, I got cake, that's what I'm payin' them for

Ha ha, ain't that funny?
'Cause niggas they want war but ain't got money
'Cause I've seen 'em all talk until they start gunnin'
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing runnin'

Yeah, Akon! Weezy!
Block Royal holdin' down Jersey
Devine makin' sure we gettin' it up front
My little brother Boo got that vision, baby

Chorus:
I get it in 'til the sun rise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Aye! Aye! Aye!, I'm so paid

Number one hustla gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustla don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid

Verse 4:
Ah-oh, big money Weezy
White wife-beater with the sig underneath it
How do I feel? Bitch, I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers, disappear from the precinct, yeah

I'm ballin', we ball out
Thoughts of we fallin' until the ball bounce
I send some niggas with guns at y'all house
Only to find out you live in a doll house

Damn! But I thought you was tough though
We carry choppers on our necks, call it cut throat
We bury powers on the set that they come from
We know magic turn weed smoke to gun smoke

We ball first when we ride
You in a Hearse when you ride
I put my shoe down baby
And I'm holdin' down Young Mula baby

Chorus:
That's why I get it in 'til the sun rise
Doin' 90 in a 65
Windows rolled down screamin' "Ah!"
Aye! Aye! Aye!, I'm so paid

Number one hustla gettin' money
Why you wanna count my money?
I'm a hustla don't need them
One of y'all, you see, I'm so paid
