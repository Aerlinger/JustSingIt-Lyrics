32 We're both looking for something25 We've been afraid to find24 It's easier to be broken19 It's easier to hide0 33 Looking at you, holding my breath39 For once in my life I'm scared to death39 I'm taking a chance, letting you inside0 32 I'm feeling alive all over again32 As deep as the sky under my skin* 48 Like being in love, she said, for the first time0 34 Maybe I'm wrong, I'm feeling right31 Where I belong with you tonight* 45 Like being in love to feel for the first time0 31 The world that I see inside you23 Waiting to come to life24 Waking me up to dreaming20 Reality in your eyes0 33 Looking at you, holding my breath39 For once in my life I'm scared to death39 I'm taking a chance, letting you inside0 32 I'm feeling alive all over again32 As deep as the sky under my skin* 48 Like being in love, she said, for the first time0 34 Maybe I'm wrong, I'm feeling right31 Where I belong with you tonight* 45 Like being in love to feel for the first time0 14 We're crashing16 Into the unknown18 We're lost in this22 But it feels like home0 32 I'm feeling alive all over again32 As deep as the sky under my skin* 48 Like being in love, she said, for the first time0 34 Maybe I'm wrong, I'm feeling right31 Where I belong with you tonight* 45 Like being in love to feel for the first time0 * 46 Like being in love she said for the first time* 45 Like being in love to feel for the first time0 11 Songwriters24 WADE, JASON / COLE, JUDE0 12 Published by* 84 Lyrics Â© Chrysalis One Music, EMI Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group0 0 0 * 54 Read more: Lifehouse - First Time Lyrics | MetroLyrics
