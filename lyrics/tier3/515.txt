Dis is, the point when I need everybody get to the dance floor

Da da da da, I like that y'all

MC

I came to have a party open up the bacardi
Feeling so hot tamale boy I know you watchin' me
So what's it gonna be?
Purple taking me higher I'm lifted and I like it
Boy, you got me inspired, baby come and get it
If you're really feelin' me

'Cuz it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin' it all behind
No tears, no time to cry
Just makin' the most of life

Everybody is livin it up
All the fellas keep lookin' at us
('Cuz)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's like that y'all
(That y'all)
That y'all
(That y'all)
It's like da da da da, I like that y'all
(That y'all)

It's like that y'all
(That y'all)
That y'all
(That y'all)
It's like da da da da, I like that y'all
(That y'all)

You like this and you know it, caution it's so explosive
Them chickens is ash and I'm lotion
Baby, come and get it let me give you what you need
It's a special occasion Mimi's emancipation
A cause for celebration I ain't gonna let nobody's drama bother me

'Cuz it's my night
No stress, no fights
I'm leavin' it all behind
No tears
(No tears)
No time to cry
Just makin' the most of life

Everybody is livin it up
All the fellas keep lookin at us
('Cuz)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's like that y'all
(That y'all)
That y'all
(That y'all)
It's like da da da da, I like that y'all
(That y'all)

It's like that y'all
(That y'all)
That y'all
(That y'all)
It's like da da da da, I like that y'all
(That y'all)

'Cuz it's my night
(It's my, it's my night)
No stress, no fights
(No stress)
I'm leaving it all behind
No tears
(No tears)
No time to cry
(Baby, I'm making the most of life)

Everybody is livin' it up
(I said everybody)
All the fellas keep lookin at us
(Lookin' at us)
Me and my girls on the floor like what
While the DJ keeps on spinnin' the cut
It's like that y'all
