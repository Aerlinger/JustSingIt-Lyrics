	<li><p>Closes the door before the winter lets the cold in</p></li>
	<li><p>And wonders if her love is strong enough to make him stay</p></li>
	<li><p>She's answered by the tail lights</p></li>
	<li><p>Shining through the window pane</p></li>
	<li><p>He said I wanna see you again</p></li>
	<li><p>But I'm stuck in colder weather</p></li>
	<li><p>Maybe tomorrow will be better</p></li>

	<li><p>At a truck stop diner just outside of Lincoln</p></li>
	<li><p>The night is black as the coffee he was drinkin'</p></li>
	<li><p>And in the waitress' eyes he sees the same 'ol light shinin'</p></li>
	<li><p>He thinks of Colorado</p></li>
	<li><p>And the girl he left behind</p></li>
	<li><p>He said I wanna see you again</p></li>

	<li><p>Got a gypsy soul to blame</p></li>
	<li><p>And you were born for leavin' (born for leavin')</p></li>

	<li><p>You know it's you who calls me back here</p></li>
	<li><p>Oh I wanna see you again</p></li>

	<li><p>And when I close my eyes I see you</p></li>
	<li><p>No matter where I am</p></li>
	<li><p>I can smell your perfume through these whispering pines</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm with your ghost again</p></li>
	<li><p>It's a shame about the weather</p></li>
	<li><p>I know soon we'll be together</p></li>
	<li><p>And I can't wait till then</p></li>
