[:chorus:]
'cause your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love

It's coming closer
The flames are now reaching my body
Please won't you help me
I feel like i'm flipping away
It's hard to breath
And my chest is a-heaving
Lord almighty
I'm burning a hole where i lay

[:chorus:]
'cause your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love
