A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a buster
Always talkin' about what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time and

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Tryin' to holla at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Tryin' to holla at me

There's a scrub checkin' me, but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' no deadbeat ass, so

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't want to give you mine and
No, I don't want to meet you nowhere
No, I don't want none of your time

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Tryin' to holla at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Tryin' to holla at me

If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes, son, I'm talkin' to you
If you live at home wit' your momma
Oh yes, son, I'm talkin' to you

If you have a shorty but you don't show love
Oh yes, son, I'm talkin' to you
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no

No scrub
No scrub
No scrub
No scrub, no, no

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Tryin' to holla at me

I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Tryin' to holla at me
