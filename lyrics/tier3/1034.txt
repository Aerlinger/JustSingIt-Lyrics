Goin' down in the same old town
Down the same street, to the same bar
And the same old faces saying, "Hi", and I don't care
Going down in the same old bar
And I, you know, I don't even order anymore

I am so sick of consequence and the look on your face
I am tired of playing defense, I don't even have hockey skates
Don't even have hockey skates

You can meet me at ten thirty
And I won't be there, I'll be gone
We can talk like we are friends, goin' over it all again
Talkin' about everything I am doin' wrong

Do you wish your nose was longer
So you'd have an excuse not to see past it?
Do you wish the lights were
Brighter in the city that you live?

I am so sick of consequence and the look on your face
I am tired of playing defense, I don't even have hockey skates
Don't even have hockey skates

You can meet me at ten thirty
Well, I won't be there, I'll be gone
We can talk like we are friends, goin' over it all again
Talkin' about everything I am doin' wrong

And do you think your boys club will crumble
Just because of a loud mouthed girl?
Just because of a loud mouthed girl?
I don't even have hockey skates

Going down in the same old town
Down the same street, to the same bar
And the same old faces saying, "Hi", and I don't care
