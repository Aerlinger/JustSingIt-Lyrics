24 I used to rule the world36 Seas would rise when I gave the word32 Now in the morning I sweep alone31 Sweep the streets I used to own0 23 I used to roll the dice32 Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes30 Listen as the crowd would sing* 47 "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!"0 25 One minute I held the key32 Next the walls were closed on me38 And I discovered that my castles stand40 Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand0 34 I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing32 Roman Cavalry choirs are singing33 Be my mirror, my sword and shield34 My missionaries in a foreign field0 31 For some reason I can't explain27 Once you go there was never20 Never an honest word35 And that was when I ruled the world0 31 It was the wicked and wild wind32 Blew down the doors to let me in40 Shattered windows and the sound of drums39 People couldn't believe what I'd become0 20 Revolutionaries wait29 For my head on a silver plate32 Just a puppet on a lonely string34 Oh who would ever want to be king?0 34 I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing32 Roman Cavalry choirs are singing33 Be my mirror, my sword and shield34 My missionaries in a foreign field0 31 For some reason I can't explain37 I know Saint Peter won't call my name20 Never an honest word35 But that was when I ruled the world0 34 I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing32 Roman Cavalry choirs are singing33 Be my mirror, my sword and shield34 My missionaries in a foreign field37 Woahahahah. woah ohhhhh woah ohhh oh,0 31 For some reason I can't explain37 I know Saint Peter won't call my name20 Never an honest word35 But that was when I ruled the world0 * 43 ooooooh ooh oooooh oh ooooooh oh oooooh oh.0 11 Songwriters* 101 MARTIN, CHRISTOPHER ANTHONY JOHN / BERRYMAN, GUY RUPERT / BUCKLAND, JONATHAN MARK / CHAMPION, WILLIAM0 12 Published by* 41 Lyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Group0 0 0 * 55 Read more: Coldplay - Viva La Vida Lyrics | MetroLyrics
