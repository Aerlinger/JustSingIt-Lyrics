* 42 This old man and me were at the bar and we* 52 Were havin' us some beers and swappin' I don't cares* 44 Talkin' politics, blonde and red head chicks* 50 Old dogs and new tricks and habits we ain't kicked0 * 54 We talked about God's grace and all the @#$% we raised28 Then I heard the ol' man say* 47 God is great, beer is good and people are crazy0 * 52 He said I fought two wars, been married and divorced* 49 What brings you to Ohio? He said damned if I know* 49 We talked an hour or two about every girl we knew* 53 What all we put 'em through like two old boys will do0 * 45 We pondered life an death, he lit a cigarette* 42 He said these @#$% things will kill me yet* 51 But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy0 * 73 Last call it's 2 a.m., I said goodbye to him, I never talked to him again* 43 Then one sunny day, I saw the old mans face* 41 Front page obituary, he was a millionaire* 46 He left his fortune to some guy he barely knew* 49 His kids were mad as @#$%, but me I am doing well0 * 50 And I dropped by today to just say thanks and pray* 46 And I left a six pack right there on his grave* 58 And I said God is great, beer is good and people are crazy0 * 47 God is great, beer is good and people are crazy* 47 God is great, beer is good and people are crazy0 11 Songwriters29 BRADDOCK, BOBBY / JONES, TROY0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 67 Read more: Billy Currington - People Are Crazy Lyrics | MetroLyrics
