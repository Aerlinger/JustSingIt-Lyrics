Pack up, Im straight, enough
Oh say, say, say

Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say

Wait, they dont love you like I love you
Wait, they dont love you like I love you
Ma-a-aps
Wait, they dont love you like I love you

Made off, dont stray
Well, my kinds your kind
Ill stay the same
Pack up, dont stray
Oh say, say, say
Oh say, say, say

Wait, they dont love you like I love you
Wait, they dont love you like I love you
Ma-a-aps
Wait, they dont love you like I love you
Wait, they dont love you like I love you
Ma-a-aps
Wait, they dont love you like I love you

Wait, they dont love you like I love you
Wait, they dont love you like I love you
Ma-a-aps
Wait, they dont love you like I love you
Wait, they dont love you like I love you
Ma-a-aps
Wait, they dont love you like I love you
