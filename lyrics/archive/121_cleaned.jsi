Signed her name on my heart with an XO
Love so sweet got me vexed though
I wanna wish it right back like Presto, yes
Meantime I wait for the next time
She come around for a toast to the best time
We LOL back and forth on the text line
She got me fishin for her love, I confess I'm..
Somethin 'bout her smile and the convo
Got me high and I ain't comin down yo
My heart's pumpin out louder than electro
She got me feelin like {MR. ROBOTO}

You got me feelin high and I can't step off the cloud
And I just can't get enough
Chorus
"This, has been a switchup"
will.i.am
Switchup! {*2X*}
I, just, can't (switchup)
Locked, sunk in your bed-rock
Heart, pumpin your love-shot
Knocked, out by your cold-shot
I'm, stuck in your head-lock (switchup)
Can't-can't stop-stop won't-won't quit-quit
Makin me f-f-f-f-f-fiend, give it to me
I want it all-all, know what I mean
Your love is a dose of ecsta (switchup)
Addicted, I can't get, away from, you
Afflicted, I need it, I miss it (switchup)
I want your lovin right next to me
And I can't, erase you out of my memory
-ory
I, just, can't, (switchup)
