Hit it
This ain't no disco
It ain't no country club either
This is L.A.

"All I wanna do is have a little fun before I die"
Says the man next to me out of nowhere
It's apropos of nothing, he says his name is William
But I'm sure he's Bill or Billy or Mac or Buddy

And he's plain ugly to me
And I wonder if he's ever had a day of fun in his whole life
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
In a bar that faces a giant car wash

The good people of the world
Are washing their cars on their lunch break
Hosing and scrubbing as best they can in skirts in suits

They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks
Back to the phone company, the record store too
Well they're nothing like Billy and me

'Cause all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

I like a good beer buzz early in the morning
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
He shreds them on the bar then he lights every match
In an oversized pack letting each one burn

Down to his thick fingers before blowing and cursing them out
And he's watching the bottles of Bud
As they spin on the floor

And a happy couple enters the bar
Dangerously close to one another
The bartender looks up from his want ads

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Otherwise the bar is ours
The day and the night and the car wash, too
The matches and the Buds and the clean and dirty cars
The sun and the moon

But all I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling I'm not the only one
All I wanna do is have some fun
I got a feeling, I'm not the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
I've got a feeling the party has just begun
All I wanna do is have some fun
I won't tell you, that you're the only one

All I wanna do is have some fun
Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard

Until the sun comes up
Over Santa Monica Boulevard
