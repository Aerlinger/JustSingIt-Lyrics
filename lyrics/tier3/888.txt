I lost my way oh baby
This stray heart
Went to another
Can you recover baby?
Oh, you are the only one that that I'm dreaming of
Your precious heart, was torn apart by me and you

You're not alone
Oh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Oh, I hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you

I said a thousand times and now a thousand one
We'll never apart
I'll never stray again from you
This dog is destined for a home to your heart
We'll never apart
I'll never stray again from you

You're not alone
Oh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Oh, I hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just cant have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just cant have you

You're not alone
Oh and now I'm where I belong
We're not alone
Oh, I'll hold your heart and never let go

Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just can't have you

Everything that I want, I want from you
But I just can't have you
Everything that I need, I need from you
But I just
Just can't have you
