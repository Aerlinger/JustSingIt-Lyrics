You say that we've got nothing in common
No common ground to start from and we're falling apart
You'll say the world has come between us
Our lives have come between us still I know you just don't care

And I said, What about breakfast at Tiffany's?
She said, "I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"

I see you, the only one who knew me
And now your eyes see through me I guess I was wrong
So what now it's plain to see we're over
And I hate when things are over when so much is left undone

And I said, What about breakfast at Tiffany's?
She said, "I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"

You say that we've got nothing in common
No common ground to start from and we're falling apart
You'll say the world has come between us
Our lives have come between us still I know you just don't care

And I said, What about breakfast at Tiffany's?
She said, "I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"

And I said, What about breakfast at Tiffany's?
She said, "I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"

And I said, What about breakfast at Tiffany's?
She said, "I think I remember the film
And as I recall, I think, we both kinda liked it
And I said, "Well, that's the one thing we've got"
