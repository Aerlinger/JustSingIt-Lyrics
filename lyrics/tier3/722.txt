We've got stars directing our fate
And we're prayin' it's not too late
Millennium

Some say that we are players, some say that we are pawns
But we've been makin' money since the day that we were born
Got some slow downs, cause we'll low down

Run a round in circles, live a life of solitude
'Till we find ourselves a partner, someone to relate to
Then we'll slow down, before we fall down

We've got stars directin' our fate
And we're prayin' it's not too late
'Cause we know we're fallin' from grace
Millennium

Live for liposuction, detox for your rent
Overdose at Christmas and give it up for lent
My friends are all so cynical refuse to keep the faith
We all enjoy the madness 'cause we know we're gonna fade away

We've got stars directin' our fate
And we're prayin' it's not too late
'Cause we know we're fallin' from grace
Millennium

Come and have a go if you think you are hard enough
Come and have a go if you think you are hard enough
Millennium
Millennium

We've got stars directin' our fate
And we're prayin' it's not too late
'Cause we know we're fallin' from grace
Millennium
Sounds like a jingle

It's like a, ha ha
And when we come we always come too late
I often think that we were born to hate
Get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes

And when we come we always come too late
I often think that we were born to hate
Get up and see the sarcasm in my eyes

We've got stars directin' our fate
And we're prayin' it's not too late
'Cause we know we're fallin' from grace
And we won't stop

We've got stars directin' our fate
And we're prayin' it's not too late
'Cause we know we're fallin' from grace
