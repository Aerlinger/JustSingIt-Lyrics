I've been down, now I'm blessed
I felt a revelation coming around
I guess it's right, it's so amazing
Every time I see you I'm alive

You're all I've got
You lift me up
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When we touch
When we love
The stars light up
The wrong becomes undone

Naturally
My soul surrenders
The sun and the moonlight
All my dreams are in your eyes

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothin' wind
I wanna be inside your heaven

When minutes turn to days and years
When mountains fall, I'll still be here
Holding you until the day I die

I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be inside in your heaven
I wanna be inside
Where the storm blows your way

And I wanna be inside your heaven
Take me to the place you cry from
Where the storm blows your way
And I wanna be the earth that holds you
Every bit of air you're breathing in, a soothing wind
I wanna be inside your heaven
