Yo this is Nappy Boy Radio live
With your boy T-Pain, we love rap music
Listen, uh, we got a caller on line one
Caller, what's your problem?

Hello, I'm on the radio with T-Pain
How's it goin'?

Brand new Chris Brown, T-Pain
You heard it here first Nappy Boy Radio
We love you

Hey, she want that lovey dovey

In her mind she fantasize 'bout gettin' with me

They wanna diss, diss
(Kiss, kiss)
Because she mine and so fine, thick as can be

She want that lovey dovey

I'm a country boy from Tappahannock, VA is where I reside
So shawty understand it and I know I just turned 18
And I get a little mannish and you see this bandana hangin'
That means I'm like a bandit like, like a bandit, bandit

With the spider seats, you never seen it
So get it shawty, we parkin' lot pimpin' in my dome
And I know what you want

In her mind she fantasize 'bout gettin' with me

They hatin' on me

They wanna diss, diss
(Kiss, kiss)
Because she mine and so fine, thick as can be

I'm the epitome of this demonstration, I got the remedy
You feelin' me, so why is you hatin' my anatomy?
It's bird like, yeah, you heard right
Girl, I'm the king so that means I'm fly, fly

If you with it girl, get it poppin'
Girl with me, ain't no stoppin'
So get it shawty, we parking lot pimpin' in my dome

You think I'd be hollerin', if you not, not, not, not?
I'm king of the town, you can take a look around
Teddy Penderaz down is in the spot, spot, spot, spot
