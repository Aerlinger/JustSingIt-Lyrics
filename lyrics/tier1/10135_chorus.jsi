Chorus:
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say i'll be ok
But i'm not going to ever get over you

Verse 2:
Living alone here in this place
I think of you, and i'm not afraid
Your favorite records make me feel better
Cause you sing along
With every song
I know you didn't mean to give them to me

[:chorus:]
Chorus:
But you went away
How dare you?
I miss you
They say i'll be ok
But i'm not going to ever get over you
