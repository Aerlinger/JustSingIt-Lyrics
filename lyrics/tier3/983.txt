You know that I would love to see you next year
I hope that I am still alive next year
You magnify the way I think about myself
Before you came I rarely thought about myself

Behind your veil I found a body underneath
Inside your head were things I never thought about
You know that I would love to see you next year
I hope that I am still alive next year

What's my view, well, how am I supposed to know?
Write a review, well, how objective can I be?
What's my view, well, how am I supposed to know?
Write a review, well, how objective can I be?

You know that I would love to see you in that dress
I hope that I will live to see you undressed
The every day is part of what consumes me
The hate I feel is part of what fuels me

I testify to having guilty feelings
I must confess I'd like to be caught stealing
You know that I would love to see you in that dress
I hope that I will live to see you undressed

What's my view, well, how am I supposed to know?
Write a review, well, how objective can I be?
What's my view, well, how am I supposed to know?
Write a review, well, how objective can I be?

I like to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure
I like to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure

What happens when you lose everything
You just start again, you start all over again
What happens when you lose everything
You just start again, you start all over again

I like to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure
I like to wait to see how things turn out
If you apply some pressure

What happens when you lose everything
You just start again, you start all over again
What happens when you lose everything
You just start again, you start all over again

What happens when you lose everything
You just start again, you start all over again
What happens when you lose some pressure
Apply some pressure, you lose some pressure
Apply some pressure, you lose some pressure

Apply some pressure, you lose some pressure
What happens when you lose some pressure
Apply some pressure, you lose everything
Well, you just start again

You know that I would love to see you next year
I hope that I am still alive next year
You know that I would love to see you in that dress
I hope that I will live to see you undressed
