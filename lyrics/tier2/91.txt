Days like this,
I want to drive away

Pack my bags
And watch your shadow fade

You chewed me up
And spit me out
Like I was poison in your mouth

You took my light
You drained me down
But that was then
And this is now

Now look at me,

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and blows,
But you're not gonna break my soul

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

I just wanna throw my phone away
Find out who is really there for me

You ripped me off,
Your love was cheap
Was always tearing at the seams,
I fell deep, you let me down,
But that was then and this is now

Now look at me,

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and blows,
But you're not gonna break my soul.

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no!

Now look at me I'm sparkling,
A firework, a dancin' flame
You won't ever put me out again
I'm glowin', oh woah,

So you can keep the diamond ring,
It don't mean nothing anyway,
In fact you can keep everything, yeah, yeah
Except for me!

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and blows,
But you're not gonna break my soul

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no

Throw your sticks and stones,
Throw your bombs and blows,
But you're not gonna break my soul

This is the part of me
That you're never gonna ever take away from me, no
