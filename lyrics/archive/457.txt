We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah!

Show stoppin' at the latest spot
The ride shinin' with the open top
Hydraulics make our heads go nod
Hair blowin' in the breeze, yo we superstars

Put in the keys, make that engine purr
3 in the back, one in the passenger
Slow creepin' 'cause we look that fly
All the boys tryin' taste our candy pie

We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah!

Bet you ain't never seen chicks ridin' this clean
Louis Vuitton seats, we do it daily
That how we keep it poppin', make sure that bass knockin'
So when you see us ridin' we call it show stoppin'

We show stoppin', we show, show stoppin'
We show stoppin', we show, show stoppin'
That's how we keep it poppin', make sure that bass knockin'
So when you see us ridin' we call it show stoppin'

We sittin' on 22's plus 2
Mink bucket seats, neon blue
Color coordinate with them shoes
Yeah, we divas but we ride like big boys do

Black tinted with a white stripe interstate
Lookin' in the mirror at my bad boy fitted, yup
Show stoppin' till they lose they breath
Turn the wheel to the right, turn the wheel to the left

We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah!

Bet you ain't never seen chicks ridin' this clean
Louis Vuitton seats, we do it daily
That how we keep it poppin', make sure that bass knockin'
So when you see us ridin' we call it show stoppin'

We show stoppin', we show, show stoppin'
We show stoppin', we show, show stoppin'
That's how we keep it poppin', make sure that bass knockin'
So when you see us ridin' we call it show stoppin'

This is for my ladies in the 280's Mercedes
In the H3, Baby Ranges, Bentley Coups, my Escaladies
Say oh
(Oh!)
Oh oh
(Oh oh!)
Break 'em off somethin' proper like a real show stopper

This is for my chicas with the Beamers, A6's
67 Chevys, Maserati or a Lexus
Ay oh
(Oh!)
Oh oh
(Oh oh!)
Break 'em off somethin' proper like a real show stopper

Gon' jingle them keys, gon' jingle them keys
Put em up real high, make sure e'rybody see em
One time
(One time)
Two times
(Two times)
Three times
(Three times)
Fo' times
(Fo' times)

Gon' jingle them keys, gon' jingle them keys
Put em up real high, make sure e'rybody see em
One time
(One time)
Two times
(Two times)
Three times
(Three times)
Fo' times
(Fo' times)

We in the car, we ride slow
We doin' things that the girls don't do
The boys stare, we smile back
All my girls in the rainbow Cadillacs, yeah!

Bet you ain't never seen chicks ridin' this clean
Louis Vuitton seats, we do it daily
That how we keep it poppin', make sure that bass knockin'
So when you see us ridin' we call it show stoppin'

We show stoppin', we show, show stoppin'
We show stoppin', we show, show stoppin'
That's how we keep it poppin', make sure that bass knockin'
So when you see us ridin' we call it show stoppin'
