In a world lit only by fire
Long train of flares
Under piercing stars
I stand watching the steam-liners roll by

The caravan thunders onward
To the distant dream of the city
The caravan carries me onward
On my way at last, on my way at last

I can't stop thinking big
I can't stop thinking big
I can't stop thinking big
I can't stop thinking big

On a road lit only by fire
Going where I want
Instead of where I should
I peer out at the passing shadows

Carried through the night into the city
Where a young man has
A chance of making good
A chance to break from the past

The caravan thunders onward
Stars winking through the canvas hood
The caravan thunders onward
On my way at last, on my way at last

I can't stop thinking big
I can't stop thinking big
I can't stop thinking big
I can't stop thinking big

I can't stop thinking big
I can't stop thinking big
In a world where I feel so small
I can't stop thinking big

I can't stop thinking big
I can't stop thinking big
I can't stop thinking big
I can't stop thinking big

I can't stop thinking big
I can't stop thinking big
In a world where I feel so small
I can't stop thinking big
