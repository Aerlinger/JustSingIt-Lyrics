Until Sally, I was never happy
I needed so much more
Rain clouds oh, they used to chase me
Down they would pour
Join my tears, allay my fears

Sent to me from Heaven
Sally Cinnamon, you're my world

I pop pop pop, blow blow bubble gum
You taste of Cherryade
There is something here you must show me
From what you are made
Sugar and spice and all things nice

Sent to me from Heaven
Sally Cinnamon you're my world, you are my world

Your eyes are gazing back from
Every little piece of glass
You seem to smile from every place
Sally Cinnamon, you are my world

Then I put the letter back in
The place where it was found
It's a pocket of a jacket
On a train in town

Sent to her from Heaven
Sally Cinnamon you're her world
