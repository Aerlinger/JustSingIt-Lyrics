[Jennifer Lopez]
Lets hit the sweet spot away, way, way
I, Im ready to go, I want candy tonight
Lets hit the sweet spot away, way, way
I, Im ready to go, I want candy tonight

[Flo Rida]
Yeah, I wanna take you back to my spot
You can be the candy girl in my shop
We both know what we craving, why not?
Make tonight first class with no stops
Girl you know, I run a love game, never play uno
You wanna leave, follow me to the 2 door
Rock your culo, love it when you call me your papi chulo
I got a thing for you, you got a thing for me
Heard she kissed the milky way and bring to life your fantasies
As we hit them up so make cool a
Touch them to make the seas split 2 ways
Youre in love with that too girl, dont play
Im just waiting to hear you say

[Jennifer Lopez]
Lets hit the sweet spot away, way, way
I, Im ready to go, I want candy tonight
I gotta taste and Im hooked on you for life
My, oh my, hit the sweet spot tonight

[Flo Rida]
Yeah, I wanna hit the spot that gets you hot
That makes you feel like everybody need to have it this week
Baby just a hit, just speak, I got your candy Shawty
Come around give it to you that deep
Ooh, dont you get me started, hit the after party
All night, to a rave to freak that I take you home
Make you moan, watch the throne
And yeah mama Im the king of these streets, gotta love it
If you want it you can have it, no question
Been a whole lot of rubber that Im touching
What you know about the candy Im hustling, mustling
Talking that Russian
Bring it back like baby who you rushing
I feel ready, now my talk is sweet nothings
Ill be the first to give your body sweet justice
So pack your luggage and lets lets...

[Jennifer Lopez]
Lets hit the sweet spot away, way, way
