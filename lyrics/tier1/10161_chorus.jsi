[:chorus:]
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said i'm terrified, but i'm not leaving
I know that i must pass this test
So just pull the trigger

Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "close your eyes, sometimes it helps"
And then i get a scary thought
That he's here means he's never lost

[:chorus:]
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said i'm terrified, but i'm not leaving
Know that i must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
