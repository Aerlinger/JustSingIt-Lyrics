[:chorus:]
Hey, hey, good lookin'
Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin'
Somethin' up with me?

Hey, sweet baby,
Don't you think maybe
We could find us
A brand new recipe?
I got a hot-rod ford
And a two-dollar bill
And i know a spot
Right over the hill
There's soda pop
And the dancin's free
So if you wanna have fun
Come along with me

[:chorus:]
Say, hey, good lookin'
Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin'
Somethin' up with me?
