Our love runs deep like a Chevy
If you fall, I'll fall with you baby
'cause that's the way we like to do it
And that's the way we like

You run around, open doors like a gentleman
Tell me "Girl," every day, "you're my everything"
'cause thats the way you like to do it
And that's the way you like

Just a little West Coast and a bit of sunshine
Hair blowing in the wind, losing track of time
Just you and I
Just you and I
Woah oh

No matter how far we go
I want the whole world to know
I want you bad
And I won't have it any other way
No matter what the people say
I know that we'll never break
Cause our love was made
Made in the USA
Made in the USA

You always read my mind like a letter
When I'm cold, you're there like a sweater
Cause that's the way you like to do it
And that's the way you like

I'll never ever let the world get the best of you
Every night we're apart, I'm still next to you
Cause that's the way I like to do it
And that's the way I like

We touch down on the East Coast
Dinner on the sky rise
Winter is the best time for walking in the city lights
You and I
You and I

Woah oh
No matter how far we go
I want the whole world to know
I want you bad
And I won't have it any other way
No matter what the people say
I know that we'll never break
Cause our love was made
Made in the USA

Baby, I'll bite the bullet
And take the blows for love
Our love, was made in the USA
Made in the USA
Made in the USA

No matter how far we go
I want the whole world to know
I want you bad
And I won't have it any other way
No matter what the people say
I know that we'll never break
Cause our love was made
Made in the USA
Made in the USA

Made in the US
Made in the US
Made in the USA
