	<li><p>So fill up your cup and, lift your lighter, and toast to life</p></li>
	<li><p>Luda</p></li>
	<li><p>They say what don't kill me, can make me stronger</p></li>
	<li><p>So two drinks a night should help me live longer</p></li>
	<li><p>I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause why tic toc to life, to arrive safely at death</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm only yearning, yeah, I'm on a roll</p></li>
	<li><p>Sometimes gotta close my eyes, just to open my soul</p></li>
	<li><p>And tonight is the night, I gotta feeling that I'm about act a fool</p></li>
	<li><p>So if you go fix some drinks me and usher are about to break some rules</p></li>
	<li><p>That's somewhere to go but the world is moving slow</p></li>
	<li><p>I was born for the fast life</p></li>
	<li><p>I go for all, and yes I'm not here to fall</p></li>
	<li><p>But the water is worth I'm ready to play for the rest of my life</p></li>
	<li><p>For the rest of my life</p></li>
	<li><p>If I got one life to live, Imma party til I'm dead</p></li>
	<li><p>What the hell is a life worth living if its not on the edge</p></li>
	<li><p>Tryna keep my balance I'm twisted so just in case I fall</p></li>
	<li><p>Ring on my tomb, don't you say women, weed, and alcohol</p></li>
	<li><p>That's somewhere to go but the world is moving slow</p></li>
	<li><p>I was born for the fast life</p></li>
	<li><p>I go for broke, and yes I'm not here to fall</p></li>
	<li><p>But for what it's worth I'm ready to play for the rest of my life</p></li>
	<li><p>For the rest of my life</p></li>
	<li><p>If you live for something, you're not alone, my friend</p></li>
	<li><p>So fill up your cup and, lift your lighter, and toast to life</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of time</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause I feel in a peace when I'm outta my mind</p></li>
	<li><p>And you can call me crazy but I like to roll the dice</p></li>
	<li><p>So I'm willing to bet that Imma be crazy for the rest of my life</p></li>
	<li><p>For the rest of my life</p></li>
	<li><p>For the rest of my life</p></li>
