[:chorus:]
And i don't want the world to see me
'cause i don't think that they'd understand
When everything's made to be broken
I just want you to know who i am

And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming
Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah you bleed just to know you're alive

[:chorus:]
And i don't want the world to see me
'cause i don't think that they'd understand
When everything's meant to be broken
I just want you to know who i am
