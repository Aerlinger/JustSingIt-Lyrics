I wish I could tie you up in my shoes make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful but what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror who's inside there the one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty
Yeah, I'll make you feel unpretty too

Never insecure until I met you, now I'm bein' stupid
I used to be so cute to me, just a little bit skinny
Why do I look to all these things? To keep you happy
Maybe get rid of you and then I'll get back to me, hey

My outsides look cool, my insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through it's because of you
I've tried different ways but it's all the same
At the end of the day I have myself to blame
People trippin'

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you, find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty
I'll make you feel unpretty too
I'll make you feel unpretty

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if you say so
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you find out who am I too
Be in a position to make me feel so damn unpretty

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can buy all the make up that M.A.C. can make
But if you can look inside you
Be in a position to make me feel so

You can buy your hair if it won't grow
