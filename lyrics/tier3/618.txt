Free that's all that she could bleed
That's why she'll never stay
White bare naked in the night
And lookin' for some play

Just another girl that wants to rule the world
Any time or place
And when she gets into your head
You know she's there to stay

You want it, she's got it
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
She's got your, your pistol
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind

Slow she's burnin' in your soul
With whispers in your ear
It's okay I'll give it anyway
Just get me out of here

You'll plead, you'll get down on your knees
For just another taste
And when you think she's let you in
That's when she fades away

You want it, she's got it
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
She's got your, your pistol
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind

You want it, well she's got it
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
She's got your, your pistol
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind

You want it, she's got it
Molly's chamber's gonna change your mind
She's got your, your pistol
