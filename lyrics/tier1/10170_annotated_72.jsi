27 Heaven bent to take my hand28 And lead me through the fire26 Be the long awaited answer27 To a long and painful fight0 32 Truth be told I've tried my best27 But somewhere along the way* 41 I got caught up in all there was to offer* 47 And the cost was so much more than I could bear0 30 Though I've tried, I've fallen18 I have sunk so low21 I've messed up better13 I should know25 So don't come 'round here25 And tell me I told you so0 29 We all begin with good intent22 Love was raw and young* 42 We believed that we could change ourselves22 The past can be undone0 * 56 But we carry on our backs the burden time always reveals30 In the lonely light of morning32 In the wound that would not heal* 61 It's the bitter taste of losing everything, I've held so dear0 11 I've fallen18 I have sunk so low21 I've messed up better13 I should know25 So don't come 'round here25 And tell me I told you so0 27 Heaven bent to take my hand27 I have nowhere left to turn* 41 I've lost to those I thought were friends18 To everyone I know0 39 Oh, they turned their heads embarrassed27 Pretend that they don't see* 53 But it's one missed step, one slip before you know it* 43 And there doesn't seem a way to be redeemed0 30 Though I've tried, I've fallen18 I have sunk so low21 I've messed up better13 I should know25 So don't come 'round here29 And tell me I told you so, no0 21 I've messed up better13 I should know26 But don't come 'round here25 And tell me I told you so0 11 Songwriters* 72 REYNOLDS, DANIEL COULTER / SERMON, DANIEL WAYNE / MCKEE, BENJAMIN ARTHUR0 12 Published by* 72 Lyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 56 Read more: Sarah McLachlan - Fallen Lyrics | MetroLyrics
