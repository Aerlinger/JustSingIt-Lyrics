Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles
And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow I want more

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved, and she will be loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know, I tend to get so insecure
It doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come anytime you want

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved, and she will be loved
And she will be loved, and she will be loved

I know where you hide alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothin' at all
Comes back and begs me to catch her every time she falls

Yeah, tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending everyday
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay awhile

And she will be loved, and she will be loved
And she will be loved, and she will be loved
(Please don't try so hard to say goodbye)

Yeah, I don't mind spending everyday
(Please don't try so hard to say goodbye)
Out on your corner in the pourin' rain
(Please don't try so hard to say goodbye)
