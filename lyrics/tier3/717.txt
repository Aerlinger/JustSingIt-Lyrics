And I feel that time's a wasted go
So where you going 'till tomorrow?
And I see that these are lies to come
So would you even care?

And I feel it
And she feels it

Where you're going for tomorrow?
Where you're going with that mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she stand alone?

Where you are going for tomorrow?
Where you are going with that mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she stand alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it

Where you are going for tomorrow?
Where you are going with that mask I found?
And I feel, and I feel
When the dogs begin to smell her
Will she stand alone?

When the dogs do find her
Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it
When the dogs do find her
Got time, time to wait for tomorrow
To find it, to find it, to find it

To find it
To find it
To find it
