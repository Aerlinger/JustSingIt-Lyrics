I'm more than just an option, hey, hey, hey
Refuse to be forgotten, hey, hey, hey
I took a chance with my heart, hey, hey, hey
And I feel it takin' over

I better find your lovin', I better find your heart
I better find your lovin', I better find your heart
I better find your lovin', I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my lovin', nothin's gonna tear us apart

I'm more than just a number, hey, hey, hey
I doubt you'll find another, hey, hey, hey
So every single summer, hey, hey, hey
I be the one that you remember

I better find your lovin', I better find your heart
I better find your lovin', I better find your heart
I better find your lovin', I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my lovin', nothin's gonna tear us apart

It's more than just a mission, hey, hey, hey
You hear but you don't listen, hey, hey, hey
You better pay attention, hey, hey, hey
And get what you been missin'

I better find your lovin', I better find your heart
I better find your lovin', I better find your heart
I better find your lovin', I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my lovin', nothin's gonna tear us apart

Too many times, I've been wrong
I guess bein' right takes too long
I'm done waitin', there's nothin' left to do
But give all I have to you

I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I better find your lovin'
I bet if I give all my lovin', nothin's gonna tear us apart

I bet if I give all my lovin', nothin's gonna tear us apart
