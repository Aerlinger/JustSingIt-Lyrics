Your mama's got nothing on me
Your daddy's got nothing on me
and the world that sleeps in it's lunacy
has got nothing on me
no star's got nothing on me
your sun's got nothing on me
and the fool who sees it's the beef that leads got nothing on me
you know its not because the light here gets brighter
and its not that I'm evil, I got a friend in the devil,
but I can't even be your friend, I can't even be your friend, I can't even be your friend....
I can get so wound up but i feel alright
and if i get some rest yeah that'd be nice
when i shouldn't do it i still do it
what's you think's got nothing to do with it
before you were born i was already sinning
yeah yeah yeah
when i get too worked up well i work it out
and if i get too down i just shout it out
i bet i have it all but the rest will do
and its nothing against all i do with you
before you were born i was already sinning
its not because the light here is brighter
and its not that I'm evil, i just don't like to pretend
that i could ever be your friend
if you don't listen so good i could hum it out
na na na na na na na na
i know i shouldn't do i just do it
what you think's got nothing to do with it
before you were born i was already sinning
its not because the light here is brighter
and it's not that i'm evil
i just don't like to pretend
that i would be your friend
i could never be your friend
i've never needed a friend
i don't wanna be friends
you'll never find a friend like me
