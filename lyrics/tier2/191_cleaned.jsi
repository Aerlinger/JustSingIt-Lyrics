Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing
I have got no service, in the club, you see, you see
Wha-Wha-What did you say, huh? You're breaking up on me
Sorry, I cannot hear you, I'm kinda busy

K-kinda busy
K-kinda busy
Sorry, I cannot hear you
I'm kinda busy

Just a second, its my favorite song they gonna play
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh?
You should've made some plans with me, you knew that I was free
And now you won't stop calling me, I'm kinda busy

Stop callin', stop callin', I don' wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop telephonin' me
(Stop telephonin' me)
I'm busy
(I'm busy)
Stop telephonin' me
(Stop telephonin' me)

Call all you want, but theres no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bubb'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Call all you want, but theres no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bubb'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Boy, the way you blowin' up my phone
Won't make me leave no faster
Put my coat on faster
Leave my girls no faster

I should've left my phone at home
'Cause this is a disaster
Callin' like a collector
Sorry, I cannot answer

Not that I don't like you, I'm just at a party
And I am sick and tired of my phone r-ringing
Sometimes I feel like I live in Grand Central Station
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls, 'cause I'll be dancin'

'Cause I'll be dancin'
'Cause I'll be dancin'
Tonight I'm not takin' no calls
'Cause I'll be dancin'

Stop callin', stop callin', I don' wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop callin', stop callin', I don' wanna think anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor
Stop callin', stop callin', I don't wanna talk anymore
I left my head and my heart on the dance floor

Stop telephonin' me
(I'm busy!)
I'm busy!
(Stop telephonin' me)
Stop telephonin' me!
(I'm busy!)

Call all you want, but theres no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bubb'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

Call all you want, but theres no one home
And you're not gonna reach my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club and I'm sippin' that bubb'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sippin' that bubb'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

My telephone, m-m-my telephone
'Cause I'm out in the club
And I'm sippin' that bubb'
And you're not gonna reach my telephone

We're sorry the number you have reached is not in service at this time
Please check the number, or try your call again
