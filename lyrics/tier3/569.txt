There's nothing I want
But money and time
Million dollar bills
And the tick tick tick tick

There's nothing more cruel
Than only nine lives
A limit in spite
Would do the trick trick trick

We could leave the house
Leave the party
Let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go

There's nothing as fun
As coming untied
And running with the kids
In the park park park park

There's nothing that's hurt
Like letting you go
A tiger-burn eyes
In the dark dark dark dark

We could leave the house
Leave the party
Let the people know
Go drown the colors of our minds and watch the cards go
It's not about just being out but knowing our people
'Cause we can get in trouble just by going free throw

And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know
And now I'm letting you know

Songwriters
Little, Joel / Yelich-O'Connor, Ella
