I keep on fallin'
In and out of love
With you

Sometimes I love ya
Sometimes you make me blue
Sometimes I feel good, at times I feel used
Lovin' you darlin' makes me so confused

I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you

Oh, oh, I never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure and cause me so much pain?
Just when I think I've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you

I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you

Oh baby
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
I, I, I, I'm fallin'
Fall

I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you

I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you

I'm fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that I'm lovin' you
