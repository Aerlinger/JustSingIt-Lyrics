I need a Winn-Dixie grocery bag full of money
Right now to the VIP section
You got Young Mula in the house tonight baby

Yeah, hello, yeah! Young, young
Young, young
Young Mula Baby

Got money and you know it
Take it out your pocket and show it
Then throw it like
This a way, that a way
This a way, that a way

Gettin' mug from everybody who see then
Hang over the wall of the VIP like
This a way, that a way
This a way, that a way

Now I was bouncing through the club
She loved the way I did it bout
I see her boyfriend hatin' like a city cop
Now I ain't never been a chicken but my fitty cocked
Say I ain't never been a chicken but my semi cocked

Now where your bar at? I'm tryna rent it out
And we so bout it bout it Now what are you about?
DJ show me love, he say my name when the music stop
Young Money, Lil Wayne, then the music drop

I make it snow, I make it flurry
I make it out alright tomorrow don't worry
Yeah, Young Wayne on them hoes
A.K.A. Mr. Make It Rain On Them Hoes

Got money and you know it
Take it out your pocket and show it
Then throw it like
This a way, that a way
This a way, that a way

Gettin' mug from everybody who see then
Hang over the wall of the VIP like
This a way, that a way
This a way, that a way

Here we go, one for the money, two for the show
Now clap your hands if you got a bank roll
Like some clap on lights in this bitch
Ima be clapping all night in this bitch

Lights off, man it's on
Creep saw me, she smiling
He muggin', who cares
Cause my goons are right here

Its nothin to a big dog
And I'm a Great Dane, I wear eight chains
I mean so much ice, they yell, "Skate Wayne!"
She wanna f**k Weezy
She wanna rape Wayne

Got money and you know it
Take it out your pocket and show it
Then throw it like
This a way, that a way
This a way, that a way

Gettin' mug from everybody who see then
Hang over the wall of the VIP like

Okay, it's Young Wayne on them hoes
A.K.A. Mr. Make It Rain On Them Hoes

Can we have a rainy day?"
Bring a umbrella, please bring a umbrella
Ella, ella, ella, eh!

But you no one ain't trickin if you got it
You know we ain't f**king if you not thick
And I cool your ass down if you think you're hot shit

So Rolex watch this I do it 4 5 6 my click
Clack goes the black hoe pimp
And just like it I blow that shit
