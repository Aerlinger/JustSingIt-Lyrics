Am I supposed to put my life on hold
Because you don't know how to act?
And you don't know where your life is going?

Am I supposed to be torn apart
Broken-hearted in a corner cryin'?
Pardon me if I don't show it

I don't care if I never see you again
I'll be alright
Take this final piece of advice and get yourself together
But either way baby, I'm gone

I'm so over it, I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers and just in case you're wonderin'
I got that new I'm-a-single-girl swag
Got me with my girls and we're singin' it
Sing!

Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey, goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey, goodbye

Cut my hair 'cause it reminded me of you
I know you like the long do
Had to switch my attitude up

Thinkin' of changin' up how I ride
No more on the passenger side
Too bad you missed out on the way that I drive it

I don't care if I never see you again
I'll be alright
Take this final piece of advice and get yourself together
But either way baby, I'm gone

I'm so over it, I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers and just in case you're wonderin'
I got that new I'm-a-single-girl swag
Got me with my girls and we're singin' it
Sing!

Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey, goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey, goodbye

H-hey, h-hey
H-hey, goodbye

I'm so over it, I've been there and back
Changed all my numbers and just in case you're wonderin'
I got that new I'm-a-single-girl swag
Got me with my girls and we're singin' it
Sing!

Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey, goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey, goodbye

Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey, goodbye
Na na na na, na na na na
Hey hey hey, goodbye
Goodbye
