It's twelve o'clock and it's a wonderful day
I know you hate me but I'll ask anyway
Won't you come with me to a place in a little town
The only way to get there's to go straight down

There's no bathroom and there is no sink
The water out of the tap is very hard to drink
Very hard to drink

You wait till tomorrow
You wait till tomorrow

You say that money isn't everything
But I'd like to see you live without it
You think you can keep on going, living like a king
Babe, but I strongly doubt it

Very hard to drink
Very hard to drink

You gonna wait too, fat boy
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow
You gonna wait too, fat boy
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow

You wait till tomorrow
You wait till tomorrow

You gonna wait too, fat boy
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow
You gonna wait too, fat boy
Fat boy, wait till tomorrow
