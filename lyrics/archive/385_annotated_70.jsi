33 Your subtleties, they strangle me29 I can't explain myself at all35 And all the wants and all the needs31 All I don't want to need at all0 * 46 The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving34 Maybe it's best you leave me alone34 A weight is lifted on this evening21 I give the final blow0 28 When darkness turns to light32 It ends tonight, it ends tonight0 37 A falling star, at least I fall alone36 I can't explain what you can explain* 42 You're finding things that you didn't know31 I look at you with such disdain0 * 46 The walls start breathing, my mind's unweaving34 Maybe it's best you leave me alone34 A weight is lifted on this evening21 I give the final blow0 28 When darkness turns to light32 It ends tonight, it ends tonight* 43 Just a little insight won't make this right* 56 It's too late to fight, it ends tonight, it ends tonight0 22 Now I'm on my own side35 It's better than being on your side0 31 It's my fault when you're blind* 43 It's better that I see it through your eyes32 All these thoughts locked inside28 Now you're the first to know0 28 When darkness turns to light32 It ends tonight, it ends tonight* 43 Just a little insight won't make this right39 It's too late to fight, it ends tonight0 36 It ends when darkness turns to light32 It ends tonight, it ends tonight* 43 Just a little insight won't make this right* 56 It's too late to fight, it ends tonight, it ends tonight0 15 Tonight, inside28 When darkness turns to light15 It ends tonight0 11 Songwriters29 RITTER, TYSON / WHEELER, NICK0 12 Published by* 41 Lyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Group0 0 0 * 70 Read more: All American Rejects - It Ends Tonight Lyrics | MetroLyrics
