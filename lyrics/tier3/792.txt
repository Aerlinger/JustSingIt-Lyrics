I don't remember feelin like this
Baby, baby, I love you
Baby, baby, I love you

I got this Jones formin in my bones from a man
Who indeed took over my soul understand
I couldn't breathe if he ever said he would leave
Get on my knees, till they bloody red baby please
See, I don't know if you get it yet, just don't know
He's like the lighter to my cigarette, watch me smoke
I never knew another human life, didn't know
Can have the power to take over mine
So baby, baby

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me sayin'
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

See, I could never feel alone with you in my life
Ill give up everything I own for you won't think twice
Almost a shame how I'm mesmerized such a shame
I loose my thought lookin in your eyes I know why
Because your kisses make my lips quiver and that's real
And when you touch me my whole body shivers I can feel
Now, I can see how another life, another life
Can have the power to take over mine, cause youre my

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me sayin'
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Brake it down
Baby, I can't see my worth I can't see
Living here on God's green earth Gods
You don't know what you've done to me, done to me
I never thought I'd need you desperately, desperately
It's kind of sick how I'm stuck on you, stuck on you
But I don't care 'cause I'm needin you, I'm needin you
And how I feel will remain the same, remains the same
Cause youre my baby, cause your my baby

Listen, and when the world starts to stress me out where I run
It's to you boy without a doubt you're the one
Who keeps me sane and I can't complain, can't complain
You're like a drug you relieve my pain, may seem strange
You're like the blood flowin through my veins
Keeps me alive and feedin my brain
Now this is how another human life, another life
Could have the power to take over mine, cause youre mine

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I love it when I hear your name, got me sayin'
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, I love you
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
