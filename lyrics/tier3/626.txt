Ladies leave yo man at home
The club is full of ballas and they pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave yo girl with her friends
'Cause its 11:30 and the club is jumpin' jumpin'

Boys say you got a girl? Yes true you got a man
But the party ain't gonna stop so lets make it hot hot!

Last week and you stayed at home alone and lonely
Couldn't find yo man he was chillin' with his homies
This week and your goin' out if he
Try to stop you your goin' off

You got ya hair done and ya nails done too
And your outfit and your fittin' the shoes
Who parlayin' at the hottest spot tonight
You're gonna find the brothas rollin' in the lexus, trucks and hummers

Boys say you got a girl? Yes true you got a man
But the party ain't gonna stop so lets make it hot hot!

Ladies leave yo man at home
The club is full of ballas and they pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave yo girl with her friends
'Cause its 11:30 and the club is jumpin' jumpin'

Ladies leave yo man at home
The club is full of ballas and they pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave yo girl with her friends
'Cause its 11:30 and the club is jumpin' jumpin'

Boys say you got a girl? Yes true you got a man
But the party ain't gonna stop so lets make it hot hot!

Call your boys 'cause tonight you're not gonna stay at home
So tell your girl she ain't coming tonight you're goin' solo
Cut her off 'cause she talks the noise you know you've
Got the right to get your party on so get your hair cut

And your car washed too, lookin' like a star, your Armani suit
You need to look your best 'cause you're turnin' heads tonight
You're gonna find a sexy chica thats gonna dance all night if you wanna

Boys say you got a girl? Yes true you got a man
But the party ain't gonna stop so lets make it hot hot!

Ladies leave yo man at home
The club is full of ballas and they pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave yo girl with her friends
'Cause its 11:30 and the club is jumpin' jumpin'

Ladies leave yo man at home
The club is full of ballas and they pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave yo girl with her friends
'Cause its 11:30 and the club is jumpin' jumpin'

All them fellas time to clown we can get down now

Shake baby shake shake shake work it work it
Twist baby twist twist twist you better dip that thang

Bounce with me, bounce bounce bounce twirk it twirk it

The club is full of ballas and they pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave yo girl with her friends
'Cause its 11:30 and the club is jumpin' jumpin'

Ladies leave yo man at home
The club is full of ballas and they pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave yo girl with her friends

The club is full of ballas and they pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave yo girl with her friends
