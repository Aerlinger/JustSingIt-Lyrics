If I lay my head down on you, would it be, would it be too late?
Cause you were my protection, from the rain inside
Made me feel loved like the old days, yeah
But I can't blame you, baby it's me that'd done wrong
Cause I broke the skies that shine above.
But I can't live, oh without you, love you, and it's hard to breath
when you're not near
But I can't lie here beside you, besides you,
cause you steal my soul when you leave
Set me free baby, set me free baby.
I need some one to hold me, wrap their arms and
embrace the air I breathe. Cause you were my shelter,
now the heart you hold is somebody else's baby
Now I can't love you baby if you don't,
but I stay in love, in love, with you.
Oh yes I do.
But I can't live, oh without you, love you,
and it's hard to breath when you're not near
But I can't lie here beside you, besides you,
cuz you steal my soul when you leave
Set me free baby, Oh set me free baby.
Don't you know that I can't, no I can't, live, oh without you,
love you, and it's hard to breath when you're not near
oh yes it is!
But I can't lie here beside you, besides you,
cause you steal my soul when you leave
Set me free babe, set me free babe.
