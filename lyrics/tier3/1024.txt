Took a bite out of a mountain range
Thought my teeth would break the mountain dead
Let's go, I wanna go all the way to the horizon

I took a drink out the ocean
I'm treading water there before I drown
Let's dive, I wanna dive to the bottom of the ocean

I took a ride, I took a ride
I wouldn't go there without you
Let's take a ride, we'll take a ride
I wouldn't leave here without you

I am a mountain, I am the sea
You can't take that away from me
I am a mountain, I am the sea
You can't take that away from me

'Cause you tear us apart with all the things you don't like
You can't understand that I won't leave 'till we're finished here
And then you'll find out where it all went wrong

I wrote a note to the jungle and it wrote me back
But I was never crowned king of the jungle
So there's an end to my horizon

I took a ride, I took a ride
I wouldn't go there without you
Let's take a ride, we'll take a ride
I wouldn't leave here without you

I am a mountain, I am the sea
You can't take that away from me
I am a mountain, I am the sea

'Cause you tear us apart with all the things you don't like
You can't understand that I won't leave 'till we're finished here
And then you'll find out where it all went wrong

Nothing lasts forever except you and me
You are my mountain, you are my sea
Love can last forever between you and me
You are my mountain, you are my sea

I am a mountain, I am the sea
You can't take that away from me
I am a mountain, I am the sea
I am a mountain, I am the sea
