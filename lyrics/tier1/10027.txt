I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, no
Woo Hoo

When I feel heavy metal
Woo Hoo!
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Woo Hoo!
Well I lie and I'm easy

All of the time
But I'm never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem
Woo Hoo!

When I feel heavy metal
Woo Hoo!
And I'm pins and I'm needles
Woo Hoo!
Well I lie and I'm easy

All of the time
But I'm never sure
Why I need you
Pleased to meet you

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh yeah
