We are young, we run green, keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights, feel alright
We wake up, we go out, smoke a fag, put it out
See our friends, see the sights, feel alright

Are we like you, I can't be sure?
Of the scene as she turns
We are strange in our worlds

But we are young, we get by, can't go mad, ain't got time
Sleep around, if we like but we're alright
Got some cash, bought some wheels, took it out, 'cross the fields
Lost control, hit a wall but we're alright

Are we like you, I can't be sure?
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange in our worlds

But we are young, we run green, keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights, feel alright

Are we like you, I can't be sure?
Of the scene, as she turns
We are strange in our world

But we are young, we run green, keep our teeth nice and clean
See our friends, see the sights, feel alright
