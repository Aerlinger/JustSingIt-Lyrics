Yeah, for the first time it's goin' down, history baby
New Three 6 Mafia, featuring Eightball and MJG, Young Buck
It's a Tennessee thing babe

I gotta stay high until I die
I gotta stay high until I die
I gotta stay high until I die
I gotta stay high until I die

Hey, call me the Juice and you know I'm a stunt
Ridin' in the car with some bump in the trunk
Tone in my lap and you know it's a pump
Breakin' down the good green, rollin' the blunt

Ghetto pimp tight girls say I'm the mayne
Ice on the wrist with the ice in the chain
Ridin' through the hood, got me grippin' the grain
And I'm sippin' the same, while I'm changin' the lane

Eyes real tight 'cause I'm chockin' the green
Vision messed up 'cause I'm drinkin' to lean
Messin' with a D-Boy, ridin' them big toys
Make your man-gal wanna get on my team

She gotta give it up before she get in my car
I ain't Denzel but I know I'm a star
'Cause when I'm in the club, I be back in the fog
In the V.I.P. part and be buyin' the bar

DJ Paul is a dog, one you do not trust
You leave your green around me nigga your green gonna get lit up
You leave your drink around me believe your drink gonna get drunk up
You leave your girl around me if she bad she gonna get stuck

These niggaz is spies, we live them lives
And keep them knives tight, ridin' round what they like
Make a couple numb, a couple will die
So purple, p-purple, p-purple and swallow it down with
The yurple, yurple, yurple it's goin' down

I gotta stay high until I die
I gotta stay high until I die

Puff puff pass nigga roll that blunt
Let's get high nigga smoke a swunt
Paul pulled out the Phantom, niggaz can't stand it
But them hoes gonna come out

Just really wanna smoke my weed
Fuck these hoes and stack my G's
Stop at the light and pause on three
Hit the mall and it be all on me but

Gotta keep one eye up on the po-po, close the window
When I roll the indo
Know they mad, 'cause I'm rollin' Benzo
This that purple, not pretend though

Three 6 Mafia them my kinfolks, so when I'm in
Memphis, Tennekee
I just might not bring my own cause them niggaz there
Let me smoke for free

What's up Mary? How you doin'?, Mary Jane, stalkin' me
Since I have met ya girl you ruined my brain, ruined my brain
You stole my heart, right from the start
So I broke you down, let momma put you in the garden

I gotta stay high until I die
I gotta stay high until I die

Shrimp roll, full of that dro
Leave the club full of Rose' Mo
Your girlfriend wanna ride with me
In a car with a pimp where she supposed to be

You ain't met no dude spit it cold as me
The bag of kush cost 650
Have a nigga who smoke Reggie Miller
Coughin' and chockin' constantly

Taste like soup when you hit it, gotta have bread to get it
Smoke all night, sleep all day that's to me the American way
Roll that shit, light that shit, hit that shit, hold that shit
Blow that shit out slow, then pass it to me bro

MJ finna sprinkle in some of that, super incredible
Have a nigga runnin' back
Where that nigga with the hood sticky number at?
Cuttin' up a cigarillo like a lumber jack

In the mornin', when I need this and breath again
A whole lotta weed but uh
I'm needin' somebody to give me what I need
When I want nothin' less then the best of the trees

DJ Paul and Juicy J, Eightball and MJG
And Young Buck we don't give a fuck we must represent this Tennessee
We drink a whole lot of Hennessy nigga got a lil' hair on his chest
Do me like Bill Clinton girl, take it out ya mouth
We'll shoot it right down on your dress

High
