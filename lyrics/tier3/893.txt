I was born in a cross-fire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain

But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm jumping Jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back

But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm jumping Jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down to my feet and I saw they bled
I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread
I was crowned with a spike right through my head
Yeah, yeah, yeah

But it's all right now, in fact, it's a gas
But it's all right, I'm jumping Jack flash
It's a gas, gas, gas

Jumping Jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping Jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping Jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping Jack flash, it's a gas

Jumping Jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping Jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping Jack flash, it's a gas
Jumping Jack flash, it's a gas
