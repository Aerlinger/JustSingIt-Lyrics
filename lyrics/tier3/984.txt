Under a sky, no one sees,
Waiting, watching it happening.
Don't hurry give it time,
Things are the way they have to be.
Slow down, give it time,
Still life, you know I'm listening.
The moment that you want is coming if you give it time

When you wake up, when you wake up,
You will find me
When you wake up, when you wake up,
You will find me

Under a sky, no one else sees,
yourself appears in front of me (,)
The sky clear .. I'm here
Waiting, what's happening.
The moment that you want is coming if you give it time

When you wake up, when you wake up,
You will find me
When you wake up, when you wake up,
You will find me
