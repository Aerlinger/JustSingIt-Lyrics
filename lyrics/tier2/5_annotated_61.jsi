35 Feeling my way through the darkness25 Guided by a beating heart39 I can't tell where the journey will end25 But I know where to start40 They tell me I'm too young to understand33 They say I'm caught up in a dream* 52 Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes22 Well that's fine by me0 32 So wake me up when it's all over28 When I'm wiser and I'm older* 41 All this time I was finding myself, and I23 Didn't know? I was lost0 32 So wake me up when it's all over28 When I'm wiser and I'm older* 41 All this time I was finding myself, and I23 Didn't know? I was lost0 40 I tried carrying the weight of the world25 But I only have two hands* 41 Hope I get the chance to travel the world26 But I don't have any plans* 41 Wish that I could stay forever this young27 Not afraid to close my eyes32 Life's a game? made for everyone19 And love is a prize0 33 So wake? me up when it's all over28 When I'm wiser and I'm older* 41 All this time I was finding myself, and I23 Didn't know? I was lost0 33 So wake? me up when it's all over28 When I'm wiser and I'm older* 41 All this time I was finding myself, and I25 I didn't know? I was lost0 24 I didn't know I was lost24 I didn't know I was lost24 I didn't know I was lost13 I didn't know0 11 Songwriters* 61 POURNOURI, ASH / BERGLING, TIM / EINZIGER, MIKE / BLACC, ALOE0 12 Published by* 60 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, EMI Music Publishing0 0 0 * 51 Read more: Avicii - Wake Me Up Lyrics | MetroLyrics
