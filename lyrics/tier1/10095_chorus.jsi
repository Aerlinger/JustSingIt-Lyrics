[:chorus:]
I'm slippin into the lava
And i'm tryin keep from goin' under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'cause i'm burnin up, burnin up for you baby

C'mon girl
I fell so fast
Can't hold myself back
High heels, red dress
All by yourself, gotta catch my breath

[:chorus:]
I'm slippin into the lava
And i'm tryin keep from goin' under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'cause i'm burnin' up, burnin' up for you baby
