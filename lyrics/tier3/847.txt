Breathe your smoke into my lungs
In the back of a car with you I stare into the sun
Still not too old to die young (x2)
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

CHORUS:
I chase your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promised forever and a day
And then you take it all away
(Then you take it all away)

Place a kiss upon my cheekbone
Then you vanish me, I'm buried in the snow
But something tells me I'm not alone (x2)
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

CHORUS:
I chase your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promised forever and a day
And then you take it all away
(Then you take it all away)

So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything
So lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

CHORUS:
I chase your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promised forever and a day
And then you take it all away
I chase your love around a figure 8
I need you more than I can take
You promised forever and a day
And then you take it all away
(Then you take it all away)
