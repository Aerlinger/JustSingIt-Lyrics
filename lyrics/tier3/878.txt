You cant go home boy, I swear you never can
You can walk a million miles and get nowhere
I got no where to go ever since I came back
Just filling in the lines for the holes, and the cracks

No one knows me
No one saves me
No one loves or hates me
Ive been away for too long

This place has a secial kind of falling apart
Like they put the whole thing together in the dark
No one knows where the edge of the knife is
And no one knows where intelligent life is

No one knows me
No one saves me
No one loves or hates me
Going straight
I only ever really wanted a break
Ive been away for too long
No I never really wanted to stay
Ive been away for too long

Ive been away for too long
Ive been away for too long

Keyholes, through key holes
[Widows through metals]
I am still hiding everyone inside
Tank girls and fly guns and slippers and boots
On my way home

Going straight
I only ever really wanted a break
Ive been away for too long
No I never really wanted to stay
I've been away...
Going straight
I only ever really wanted a break
Ive been away for too long
No I never really wanted to stay
Ive been away for too long
