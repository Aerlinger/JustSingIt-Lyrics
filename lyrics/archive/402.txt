Breakin' it off and settin' it off in the real way
Makin' the girls them chill their mind

Yeah man, S Peezy, yo, long side Ri Ri
Come down now Rihanna, take it to them, take it to them, girl

Break it off boy this has got me feelin' naughty
I wanna know boy if I could be your shorty
(Most definitely)
Set it off boy, make me hot all over my body
(Break it off, take it off, no miss take it off)
Break it off tonight

Break it off boy this has got me feeling naughty
I wanna know boy if I could be your shorty
Set it off boy, make me hot all over my body
Break it off tonight

Struggle and pain wha she fell all da while
And she want a good man to give her da style
Wild child, so she dere pon me file
It's a long time now me wha plow de sile

Plow de sile meh car run like de Nile
And de most energy meh wan' gi her tonight
Give her tonight gan makes ya feel right
Makes ya fly like a kite and reach a new height, ya

We give it to de gyal dem make dem reel up and bawl
And make dem start call
Anytime she want it back she ha fi call Dutty Paul
Admittin' it on de spot I know de real Sean Paul

'Cause she feelin' top up and tall wat de ting say

Break it off boy this has got me feelin' naughty

Break it off tonight

Break it off boy this has got me feeling naughty
I wanna know boy if I could be your shorty
Set it off boy, make me hot all over my body
Break it off tonight
