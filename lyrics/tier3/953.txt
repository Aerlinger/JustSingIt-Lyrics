Hey, Ratatat, yeah
Na na na na
Na na na na

Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit feelin' light, 2 A.M. summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel, drivin' drunk, I'm doin' my thing
Rollin' the Midwest side and out livin' my life gettin' out dreams

People told me slow my road, I'm screaming out "fuck that"
Imma do just what I want, lookin' ahead, no turnin' back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about them night terrors every night
5 A.M., cold sweats wakin' up to the sky

Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams
Tell me what you know about night terrors, nothin'
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in a bed full of sorrow

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness
I know everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good

Pursuit of happiness, yeah
I don't get it, I'll be good
