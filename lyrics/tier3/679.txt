Uh uh, check it out, uh, Junior Mafia uh
I like this, yeah, uh, yeah, 94

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical duches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club, sippin' moet, is where you'll find me

The back of the club, mackin' ***, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', *** passin', music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honies biggie gotta creep with

Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got caught
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig and in the bed
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy

No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's
C notes by the layers, true da life players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS-3, I got the *** by the tree

I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies gettin' money playin' fellas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
If you got a *** up in your waist please don't shoot up the place, why?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby, baby, uh

Straight up honey really I'm askin'
Most of these fellas think they be mackin' but they be actin'
Who they attractin' with that line, "What's your name, what's your sign?"
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind

And ask what your interests are, "Who you be with?"
Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while, I'm gon' go call my crew
You go call your crew, we can rendezvous at the bar around two

Plans to leave, throw the keys to lil' cease
Pull the truck up, front and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A T bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape

Conversate for a few 'cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo
Forget the telly we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the Jacuzzi Smoke, *** while you do me

I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies gettin' money playin' fellas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
If you got a *** up in your waist please don't shoot up the place, why?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby, baby, uh

How ya livin' Biggie Smallz?
In mansion and Benz's, givin' ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream, get a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams

Choppin' O's, smokin' lye an' optimo's
Money *** and clothes all a brother knows a foolish pleasure, whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure

However living better now Gucci sweater now
Drop top BM's I'm the man girlfriend
Honey check it, tell your friends, to get with my friends
And we could be friends, *** we can do this every weekend
Aight? Is that aight with you? Yeah, keep bangin'

I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air, if youse a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies gettin' money playin' fellas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
If you got a *** up in your waist please don't shoot up the place, why?
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby, baby, uh

Uh, check it out, uh, Puff Daddy, Biggie Smalls
Junior Mafia, represent baby baby, uh
