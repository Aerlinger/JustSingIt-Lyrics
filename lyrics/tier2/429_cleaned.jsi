Hit the playa's club for about a month or two
Put his hand on it then see what it do

Take it off, let if flop, shake it freely
And I don't tell stories, I let em tell theyself
And you ain't gotta sell ***, girl, it sell itself

But that big city bottom fill me up with joy
Ain't life grand? Live it up daddy
Here go da whisper song, baby this is us, ready?

Put it on me, enthusiastically
Whatever it is that chu do, you do it admirably
And I ain't choose it, that thang chose me
It's Bubba K. and Ying Yang, all the way in this thang

Hi there, how are things?
I once was a ****** man
Now it seems ever since I had the pleasure
Of getting you together, your chest is just whatever
I found the buried treasure

Yes ma'am, here's the plan
Meet me over yonder, okay? Don't play
I'll bring the whoop whoop, you bring your cookbook
And I'ma fix that stuff up, everything is good good

Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere
Rockin' everywhere, rockin' everywhere

Hit the playa's club for about a month or two
Put his hand on it then see what it do

I found you Ms. New Booty
Get it together and bring it back to me
Hit the playa's club for about a month or two
Put his hand on it then see what it do
