Ay yo, you know what I feel like doing?
I feel like doing another Darkchild remix
'99, Darkchild, Jennifer

Come on and dance a little
Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Baby work it out and just dance a little

Come on and dance a little
Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Baby work it out and just dance a little

Come on and dance a little
Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Baby work it out and just dance a little

Now if I give you me
This is how it's got to be
First of all I won't take you cheating on me
And who can I trust, if I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool

You said that we could possibly spend eternity
See that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me
You have to be fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
And call me baby

You said you want my love
And you've got to have it all
But first there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live with all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

I don't want you tryin' to get with me
And I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt and I don't need the pain
So before I do, give myself to you
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
And call me baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
And call me baby

Come on and dance a little
Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Baby work it out and just dance a little

Come on and dance a little
Let me see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Darkchild, Jennifer Lopez, come on

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
And call me baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me?
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me?
And call me baby
