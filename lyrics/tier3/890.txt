You are the loneliest person
That I've ever known.
We are joined at the surface
But nowhere else.

I look in the glass
And stare at your strained,
Grey, motionless face and ask:
"Underneath is there a golden soul?"

Take care of the ones that you love
Take care of the ones that you love

Baby I'm leaving here.
You need to be with somebody else.
I can't stop bleeding here.
Can you suture my wounds?

Everyone is beginning to breath
As I break down.
You are in love with a shadow
That won't come back.

Sooner or later
We all have to wake
And try forgetting everything
Underneath there's a perfect sky.

Baby I'm leaving here.
You need to be with somebody else.
I can't stop bleeding here.
Can you suture my wounds and feelings?

Baby I'm leaving here.
You need to be with somebody else.
I can't stop bleeding here.
Can you suture my wounds and feelings?

Ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah, ah ah

Baby I'm leaving here.
You need to be with somebody else.
I can't stop bleeding here.
Can you suture my wounds and feelings?

Baby I'm leaving here.
You need to be with somebody else.
I can't stop bleeding here.
Can you suture my wounds?
