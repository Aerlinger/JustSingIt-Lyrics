Turn this club around
Ayo ayo
Ayo ayo

If you want more
Just check my swagger on the dance floor
There are the ladies gonna knock my door
Gonna be the time of your life
Gonna do it tonight
Do it tonight

Something's heatin up, heatin up
Go check my floor
Hey meet me up, meet me up
On the v.I.p. floor
Dj speed it up, speed it up
Play it loud
We gonna turn this club around

We gonna make our bitches working on the floor
Wanna see my sexy ladies screaming give me more
Yeah we can turn this club around
Gonna burn it, burn it down singing

Ayo ayo
Ayo ayo

Come on, let's rock that booty and make me lose my mind
My rock is slowly with champagne every saturday night
Yeah we can turn this club around
Gonna burn it burn it down singing

Ayo ayo
Ayo ayo

(Let's go)
(Ey)

Look at my glance
I got no time for intellectual ro-romance
I'm going crazy watching you the way you dance
Gonna be time of your life
Gonna do it tonight
Do it tonight
Something's heatin up, heatin up
Go check my floor
Hey meet me up, meet me up
On the v.I.p. floor
Dj speed it up, speed it up
Play it loud
We gonna turn this club around

We gonna make our bitches working on the floor
Wanna see my sexy ladies screaming give me more
Yeah we can turn this club around
Gonna burn it, burn it down singing

Ayo ayo
Ayo ayo

Come on, let's rock that booty and make me lose my mind
My rock is slowly with champagne every saturday night
Yeah we can turn this club around
Gonna burn it burn it down singing

Ayo ayo
Ayo ayo

(Let's go)
(Ey)

A good time y'all

Feel this song, make sure you do
You don't stay, we are, come back with the beat... we are true
Never get away...
B-better rock this all the way singing

Ayo

We gonna make our bitches working on the floor
Wanna see my sexy ladies screaming give me more
Yeah we can turn this club around
Gonna burn it, burn it down singing

Ayo ayo
Ayo ayo

Come on, let's rock that booty and make me lose my mind
My rock is slowly with champagne every saturday night
Yeah we can turn this club around
Gonna burn it burn it down singing

Ayo ayo
Ayo ayo
