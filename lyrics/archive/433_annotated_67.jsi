15 Where'd you go?14 I miss you so,29 Seems like it's been forever,22 That you've been gone.0 37 She said "Some days I feel like @#$%,* 54 Some days I wanna quit, and just be normal for a bit,"* 50 I don't understand why you have to always be gone,* 46 I get along but the trips always feel so long,* 47 And, I find myself trying to stay by the phone,* 55 'Cause your voice always helps me to not feel so alone,* 57 But I feel like an idiot, workin' my day around the call,* 44 But when I pick up I don't have much to say,* 45 So, I want you to know it's a little @#$% up,* 47 That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',* 54 Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career,* 60 Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?"0 14 I miss you so,29 Seems like it's been forever,22 That you've been gone.15 Where'd you go?14 I miss you so,29 Seems like it's been forever,22 That you've been gone,24 Please come back home...0 * 42 You know the place where you used to live,37 Used to barbecue up burgers and ribs,* 67 Used to have a little party every Halloween with candy by the pile,* 49 But now, you only stop by every once and a while,* 41 @#$%, I find myself just fillin' my time,* 54 With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind,* 53 I'm doin' fine, and I'm plannin' to keep it that way,* 59 You can call me if you find that you have something to say,* 60 And I'll tell you, I want you to know it's a little @#$% up,* 47 That I'm stuck here waitin', at times debatin',* 54 Tellin' you that I've had it with you and your career,* 60 Me and the rest of the family here singing "Where'd you go?"0 14 I miss you so,29 Seems like it's been forever,22 That you've been gone.15 Where'd you go?14 I miss you so,29 Seems like it's been forever,22 That you've been gone,24 Please come back home...0 * 41 I want you to know it's a little @#$% up,* 48 That I'm stuck here waitin', no longer debatin',* 53 Tired of sittin' and hatin' and makin' these excuses,* 50 For why you're not around, and feeling so useless,* 43 It seems one thing has been true all along,* 53 You don't really know what you've got 'til it's gone,* 45 I guess I've had it with you and your career,* 57 When you come back I won't be here and you can sing it...0 15 Where'd you go?14 I miss you so,29 Seems like it's been forever,22 That you've been gone.15 Where'd you go?14 I miss you so,29 Seems like it's been forever,22 That you've been gone,24 Please come back home...24 Please come back home...24 Please come back home...24 Please come back home...24 Please come back home...0 11 Songwriters13 SHINODA, MIKE0 12 Published by* 41 Lyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Group0 0 0 * 59 Read more: Fort Minor - Where'd You Go Lyrics | MetroLyrics
