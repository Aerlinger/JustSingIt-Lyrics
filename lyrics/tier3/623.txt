It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do I feel the pain
With or without you

Baby I don't understand
Just why we can't be lovers
Things are getting out of hand
Tryin' too much but baby we can't win

Let it go if you want me girl let me know
I am down on my knees
I can't take it anymore

It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do I feel the pain
With or without you, oh, all right

Baby don't misunderstand, don't misunderstand
What I'm trying to tell ya
In the corner of my mind, corner of my mind
Baby it feels like we're running out of time

Let it go if you want me girl let me know
I am down on my knees
I can't take it anymore

It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
But when we are apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do I feel the pain
With or without you

Tearin' up my heart and soul
We're apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do I feel the pain
With or without you

Tearin' up my heart and soul, all right
We're apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do I feel the pain
With or without you

It's tearin' up my heart when I'm with you
So when we are apart I feel it too
And no matter what I do I feel the pain
With or without you

And no matter what I do I feel the pain
With or without you
