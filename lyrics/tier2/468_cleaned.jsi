It's just the cutest thing
When you get to fussing, cussing
Yelling and throwing things
I just wanna eat you up

I don't mean no disrespect
When I start staring
Knowing that it makes you mad
I'm sorry that seeing you mad is so sexy

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place? Yeah

Could it be the little way that you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down?
Baby, I ain't sure, but one thing that I do know is

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
When you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you

When we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so @#$% sexy
When you're mad

Baby, don't think I don't take you seriously
But I just can't help the fact yo' attitude excites me
So exciting
And you know ain't nothing better
Then when we get
Mad together and have angry sex
Oh, I'll blow you out
Then we forget what we were mad about

Could it be the little wrinkle over your nose
When you make your angry face
That makes me wanna just take off all your clothes
And sex you all over the place?

Could it be the little way that you storm around
That makes me wanna tear you down?
Baby, I'm not sure, but one thing that I do know is

Every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you

And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so @#$% sexy

And every time you scream at me
I wanna kiss you
Baby when you put your hands on me
I wanna touch you

And when we get to arguing
Just gotta kiss you
Baby, I don't know why it's like that
But you're just so @#$% sexy
When you're mad
