Come enjoy the life, baby, take a ride
I just wanna find you, you
Baby you and I can have a good time
Tell me what you like ooh, ooh

Now listen, I've been single for a while now
And I been kinda lonely
I've been looking for somebody to talk to, love me
Someone who can hold me, is that you?

I'm looking for somebody I can call boo
Looking for the only one that I can give my all to
Tell me if it's you, you, you
What you wanna do, do, do?
Make ya move

You can be my teacher I'll do homework
You can give me extra credit baby I'll do more work
What you wanna do, do, do?
Now it's me and you, you, you
The mood is

The mood is so right, how it feels so right
You can be my prince, my knight
You can be my Superman, save me here I am

'Cause baby, there's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy

There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy

You and me together, picture perfect
I'll spend all my money, all the time because you're worth it
It's just me and you, you, you
What you wanna do, do, do?
Make ya move

Call me momma, spoil you like a baby
Thinking 'bout you, dreaming 'bout you got me goin' crazy
What you wanna do, do, do?
Now it's me and you, you, you
The mood is

The mood is so right, how it feels so right
You can be my prince, my knight
You can be my Superman, save me here I am

Baby, there's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy

There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy

Oh! I mean everything that I say
From the bottom of my heart
I would never, never ever hurt you
I'll open my heart

Open my heart, give it to you
Tell the whole world that I'm in love with you
Whatever you want, baby I'll do
I know I don't want nobody else but you

There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy

There's nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
(I will give my all to you my baby boo my love is true, oh!)
I promise that I will never lie to you, boy

Come on boy and join me I'll be waitin', waitin', waitin' for you
You can be my homie I'll be waitin', waitin', waitin' for you
Baby, come and hold me I'll be waitin', waitin', waitin' for you
Lookin' for my one and only, you can be my one and only
