We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say, I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?

Take on me
(Take on me)
Take me on
(Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say, I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me, it's no better to be safe than sorry

Take on me
(Take on me)
Take me on
(Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, the things that you say
Is it life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away, I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me
(Take on me)
Take me on
(Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day
(Take on me, take on me)
(Take me on, take on me)

I'll be gone
(Take on me)
In a day
(Take me on)
Take on me
(Take on me)
Take on me
(Take me on)
Take on me
