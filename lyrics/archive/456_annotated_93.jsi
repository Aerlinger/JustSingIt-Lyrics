* 52 She was driving last Friday on her way to Cincinnati29 On a snow white Christmas Eve40 Going home to see her Mama and her Daddy29 With the baby in the backseat0 * 41 Fifty miles to go and she was running low21 On faith and gasoline26 It'd been a long hard year0 * 54 She had a lot on her mind and she didn't pay attention26 She was going way too fast35 Before she knew it she was spinning30 On a thin black sheet of glass0 * 46 She saw both their lives flash before her eyes32 She didn't even have time to cry17 She was so scared33 She threw her hands up in the air0 21 Jesus, take the wheel21 Take it from my hands31 Cause I can't do this on my own0 14 I'm letting go26 So give me one more chance32 To save me from this road I'm on21 Jesus, take the wheel0 * 60 It was still getting colder when she made it to the shoulder26 And the car came to a stop* 48 She cried when she saw that baby in the backseat20 Sleeping like a rock0 37 And for the first time in a long time26 She bowed her head to pray30 She said I'm sorry for the way24 I've been living my life0 25 I know I've got to change22 So from now on tonight0 21 Jesus, take the wheel21 Take it from my hands31 Cause I can't do this on my own0 14 I'm letting go26 So give me one more chance37 To save me from this road I'm on (x2)0 24 Oh Jesus, take the wheel18 Oh, I'm letting go0 26 So give me one more chance29 Save me from this road I'm on21 From this road I'm on21 Jesus, take the wheel28 Oh, take it, take it from me0 11 Songwriters* 48 JAMES, BRETT / LINDSEY, HILLARY / SAMPSON, GORDY0 12 Published by* 93 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, WINDSWEPT HOLDINGS LLC, BMG RIGHTS MANAGEMENT US, LLC0 0 0 * 72 Read more: Carrie Underwood - Jesus, Take The Wheel Lyrics | MetroLyrics
