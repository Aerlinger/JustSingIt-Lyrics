Tell me lies and fall apart
But don't tell me to change
Whoa, don't give me that face
Secret call, cracks in this use
Bitter self, fashion fronting

Oh, this last dance, turn away, turn away
Oh, this last dance, touch mine...
Don't walk away
Tell me lies and fall apart
But don't tell me to change
Whoa, don't give me that face
Swollen feathers, I fall apart
Game on, game on, tonight

Oh, this last dance, turn away, turn away
Oh, this last dance, touch mine...
Don't walk away
It's the last dance
It's tough to face, tough to face
It's the last dance, last dance
It's tough to face, tough to face
It's the last dance, last dance

Tell me lies and fall apart
But don't tell me to change, no
Whoa, don't give me that face
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
