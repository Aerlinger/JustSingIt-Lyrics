27 I hung up the phone tonight37 Something happened for the first time38 Deep inside it was a rush, what a rush0 21 Cause the possibility37 That you would ever feel the same way* 41 About me, is just too much, just too much0 37 Why do I keep running from the truth?29 All I ever think about is you36 You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized22 And I just got to know0 39 Do you ever think when you're all alone* 44 All that we can be, where this thing can go?30 Am I crazy or falling in love?32 Is it really just another crush?0 * 41 Do you catch a breath when I look at you?39 Are you holding back like the way I do?39 Cause I've tried and tried to walk away* 46 But I know this crush aint going away-ay-ay-ay19 Going away-ay-ay-ay0 29 Has it ever crossed your mind39 When we're hanging, spending time girl?* 50 Are we just friends? Is there more? Is there more?0 34 See it's a chance we've gotta take* 42 Cause I believe that we can make this into* 48 Something that will last, last forever, forever!0 39 Do you ever think when you're all alone* 48 All that we could be, where this thing could go?30 Am I crazy or falling in love?32 Is it really just another crush?0 * 41 Do you catch a breath when I look at you?39 Are you holding back like the way I do?39 Cause I've tried and tried to walk away* 46 But I know this crush aint going away-ay-ay-ay19 Going away-ay-ay-ay0 37 Why do I keep running from the truth?29 All I ever think about is you36 You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized22 And I just got to know0 39 Do you ever think when you're all alone* 48 All that we could be, where this thing could go?30 Am I crazy or falling in love?32 Is it really just another crush?0 * 41 Do you catch a breath when I look at you?39 Are you holding back like the way I do?39 Cause I've tried and tried to walk away* 46 But I know this crush aint going away-ay-ay-ay36 This crush ain't going away-ay-ay-ay0 10 Going away19 Going away-ay-ay-ay19 Going away-ay-ay-ay0 11 Songwriters* 47 HODGES, DAVID / CATES, JESS / KIRIAKOU, EMANUEL0 12 Published by29 Lyrics Â© EMI Music Publishing0 0 0 * 55 Read more: David Archuleta - Crush Lyrics | MetroLyrics
