Well I guess I lost this round
The mountains have come down
I won't go where they go
No, I'll be back around
With our heads above the trees
And the storm at our knees
Come over tides and tows
We'll stand above the sea
Highs and Lows
There are pits and lands
On the ground that you stand
So Flux and flow
Flux and flow
When, we taste abitter end
And hunger life again
We take another turn
With a better hand
Highs and low
There are pits and lands
On the ground that you stand
Flux and flow
And you fix your plans
Then you trade in your hand
So Flux and flow
Flux and flow
Flux and flow
Flux and flow
(SHAD)In the rat race
Ready Set Go
My heavy step's slow
But I'm first at the finish line
Simply cuz I never left home
I'm a rock man-megadeath
That's key-treble clef
Lead, better yet just be
Let 'em see how you get your fresh
How you get free
How you shake 'em
Epilepsy with that etch-a-sketch scenes
Then remake them
Show 'em how you bend without breakin'
(Part 1 (Part 1 and 2 sung at same time) So Flux and flow
Flux and flow
Flux and flow
Flux and flow
(Part 2) Highs and Lows
There are pits and lands
On the ground that you stand.
Flux and flow, and you fix your plans
Then, you trade in your hand
Flux, there are pits and lands
On the ground that you stand
Flux, And you fix your plans
Then, you trade in your hand
