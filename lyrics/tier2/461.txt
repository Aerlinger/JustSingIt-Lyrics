Ha, ha ha, ha ha
Ha, ha ha, ha
Ha ha, ha ha, ha ha
Ha, ha ha, ha

It's funny how a man only thinks about the
You got a real big heart, but I'm looking at your
You got real big brains, but I'm looking at your
Girl, there ain't no pain in me looking at your

I don't give a
Keep looking at my
'Cause it don't mean a thing if you're looking at my
Ha, I'ma do my thing while you're playing with your
Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha ha

Every boy's the same
Since I been in the seventh grade
They've been trying to get with me
Trying to ha ha ha, ha ha ha

They always got a plan
To be my one and only man
Want to hold me with their hands
Want to ha ha ha, ha ha ha

I keep turning em down
But, they always come around
Asking me to go around
That's not the way it's going down

'Cause they only want, only want
My ha ha ha, ha ha ha
Only want what they want
But, na ah ah, na ah ah

It's funny how a man only thinks about the
You got a real big heart, but I'm looking at your
You got real big brains, but I'm looking at your
Girl, there ain't no pain in me looking at your

I don't give a
Keep looking at my
'Cause it don't mean a thing if you're looking at my
Ha, I'ma do my thing while you're playing with your
Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha ha

Do you know that no'
Don't mean yes'? It means no
So just hold up, wait a minute
Let me put my two cents in it

One, just be patient
Don't be rushing
Like you're anxious
And two, you're just too aggressive
Trying to get your ahh

Do you know that I know?
And I don't want to go there

They only want, only want
My ha ha ha, ha ha ha
Only want what they want
But, na ah ah, na ah ah

It's funny how a man only thinks about the
You got a real big heart, but I'm looking at your
You got real big brains, but I'm looking at your
Girl, there ain't no pain in me looking at your

I don't give a
Keep looking at my
'Cause it don't mean a thing if you're looking at my
Ha, I'ma do my thing while you're playing with your
Ha ha ha ha, ha ha

Ooh, you've got it bad I can tell
You want it bad, but oh well
What you got for me
Is something I, something I don't need
Hey!

It's funny how a man only thinks about the
You got a real big heart, but I'm looking at your
You got real big brains, but I'm looking at your
Girl, there ain't no pain in me looking at your

I don't give a
Keep looking at my
'Cause it don't mean a thang if you're looking at my
Ha, I'ma do my thang while you're playing with your
Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha ha

It's funny how a man only thinks about the
You got a real big heart, but I'm looking at your
You got real big brains, but I'm looking at your
Girl, there ain't no pain in me looking at your

I don't give a
Keep looking at my
'Cause it don't mean a thing if you're looking at my
Ha, I'ma do my thing while you're playing with your
Ha, ha ha, ha ha ha ha
