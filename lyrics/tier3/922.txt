"I lie awake, staring out at the bleakness of Megadon. City and sky become one, merging into a singl
"My friend Jon always said it was nicer here than under the atmospheric domes of the Outer Planets
I believed what I was told. I thought it was a good life, I thought I was happy. Then I found someth
And the meek shall inherit the earth
