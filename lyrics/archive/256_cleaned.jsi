Let It Rock"
(feat. Lil Wayne)
I see your dirty face
High behind your collar
What is done in vain
Truth is hard to swallow
So you pray to God
To justify the way you live a lie
Live a lie
Live a lie
Live a lie
And you take your time
And you do your crime
Well you made your bed
I'm in mine
[Chorus:]
Because when I arrive
I, I'll bring the fire
Make you come alive
I can take you higher
What this is, forgot?
I must now remind you
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
[Kevin Rudolph]
Now the son's disgraced
He, who knew his father
When he cursed his name
Turned, and chased the dollar
But it broke his heart
So he stuck his middle finger
To the world
To the world
To the world
And you take your time
And you stand in line
Well you'll get what's yours
I got mine
[Chorus]
[Lil Wayne]
Yeah!
Wayne's world
Planet Rock
Panties drop
And the tops
And she gonna rock 'til the camera stop
And I sing about angels like Angela (rock)
And Pamela (rock)
And Samantha (rock)
And Amanda (rock)
And Tamara (rock)
"Ménage à trois" [french for: 3-some]
I'm in here like @#$% what's up
Mechanic, me, I can fix you up
I can @#$% you up
I can @#$% you down
Shorty we can go wherever just pick a town
And the jewelry is louder than an engine sound
Big @#$% rocks like off the ground
Dirty like socks that's on the ground
Weezy
[Chorus x2]
Just Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock
Let It Rock...
Let It Rock...
[Lil Wayne]
I'm back like I forgot somethin
I'm somethin
Ruling Rock rubbin' rap running'
Miles like I'm trying to get a flat stomach
Like Wayne the personal trainer
My aim is perfect I'll bang ya
Period, like the reminder
[Kevin Rudolph]
I wish I could be
As cruel as you
And I wish I could say
The things you do
But I can't and I won't live a lie
No, not this time.
