On my way up north
Up on the Ventura
I pulled back the hood
And I was talking to you

And I knew then it would be
A life long thing
But I didn't know that we
We could break a silver lining

And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you

Things you said that day
Up on the 101
The girl had come undone
I tried to downplay it

With a bet about us
You said that you'd take it
As long as I could
I could not erase it

And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you

And I ride along side
And I rode along side you then
And I rode along side
Till you lost me there in the open road

And I rode along side
Till the honey spread itself so thin
For me to break your bread
For me to take your word I had to steal it

And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you
I could pick back up whenever I feel

Down New Mexico way
Something about the open road
I knew that he was
Looking for some Indian blood

And find a little in you find a little
In me we may be
On this road but we're just impostors
In this country you know

So we go along and we said we'd fake it
Feel better with Oliver stone
Till I almost smacked him
Seemed right that night and

I don't know what takes hold
Out there in the desert cold
These guys think they must
Try and just get over on us

And I'm so sad like a good book
I can't put this day back
A sorta fairytale with you
A sorta fairytale with you

And I was ridin' by, ridin' along side
For a while till you lost me
And I was ridin' by, ridin' along
Till you lost me, till you lost me

In the rear view
You lost me, I said

Way up north I took my day
All in all was a pretty nice day
And I, I put the hood right back where
You could taste heaven perfectly

Feel out the summer breeze
Didn't know when we'd be back
And I, I don't, didn't think
We'd end up like, lying there
