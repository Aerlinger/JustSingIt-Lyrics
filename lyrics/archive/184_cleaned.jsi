Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Yeah
I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
Cause after all the partyin’ and smashin’ and crashin’
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you’re staring at that phone in your lap
And you hoping but them people never call you back
But that’s just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for?
If you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane, sorry I’m late
I’m on my way so don’t close that gate
If I don’t make that then I’ll switch my flight
And I’ll be right back at it by the end of the night
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
like shooting stars (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
like shooting stars (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Yeah, yeah
Somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryin’ to get a tip at Subway
And back when I was rappin’ for the @#$% of it
But nowadays we rappin’ to stay relevant
I’m guessin’ that if we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Then maybe yo maybe I’ll go back to the days
Before the politics that we call the rap game
And back when ain’t nobody listened to my mix tape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang
But this is for Decatur, what’s up, Bobby Ray
So can I get a wish to end the politics
And get back to the music that started this @#$%
So here I stand and then again I say
I’m hopin’ we can make some wishes outta airplanes
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
like shooting stars (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
like shooting stars (shooting stars)
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
I could really use a wish right now (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I,I,I could really use a wish right now (right now)
Like, like, like shooting stars (oh, oh, ah-ah)
I,I,I could,I could really use a wish right now (right now)
A wish, a wish right now (a wish right now)
