	<li><p>Time will bring the real end of our trial</p></li>
	<li><p>One day they'll be no remnants</p></li>
	<li><p>No trace, no residual feelings within ya</p></li>
	<li><p>One day you won't remember me</p></li>
	<li><p>Your face will be the reason I smile</p></li>
	<li><p>But I will not see what I cannot have forever</p></li>
	<li><p>I'll always love ya, I hope you feel the same</p></li>
	<li><p>Oh you played me dirty, your game was so bad</p></li>
	<li><p>You toyed with my affliction</p></li>
	<li><p>Had to fill out my prescription</p></li>
	<li><p>Found the remedy, I had to set you free</p></li>
	<li><p>Away from me</p></li>
	<li><p>To see clearly the way that love can be</p></li>
	<li><p>When you are not with me</p></li>
	<li><p>I had to leave, I have to live</p></li>
	<li><p>I had to lead, I had to live</p></li>
	<li><p>If I can't have you, let love set you free</p></li>
	<li><p>To fly your pretty wings around</p></li>
	<li><p>Pretty wings, your pretty wings</p></li>
	<li><p>Your pretty wings around</p></li>
	<li><p>I came wrong you were right</p></li>
	<li><p>transformed your love into light</p></li>
	<li><p>baby believe me I'm sorry I told you lies</p></li>
	<li><p>I turned day into night</p></li>
	<li><p>sleep till I died a thousand times</p></li>
	<li><p>I shoulda showed you</p></li>
	<li><p>Better night better times better days</p></li>
	<li><p>I miss you more, more</p></li>
	<li><p>If I can't have you, let love set you free</p></li>
	<li><p>To fly your pretty wings around</p></li>
	<li><p>Pretty wings, your pretty wings</p></li>
	<li><p>Your pretty wings around</p></li>
