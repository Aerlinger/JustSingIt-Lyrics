	<li><p>I'm about to lose my mind</p></li>
	<li><p>You've been gone for so long</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm running out of time</p></li>
	<li><p>I need a doctor</p></li>
	<li><p>Call me a doctor</p></li>
	<li><p>I need a doctor, doctor</p></li>
	<li><p>To bring me back to life</p></li>
	<li><p>I told the World one day I would pay it back</p></li>
	<li><p>Say it on tape, and lay it, record it</p></li>
	<li><p>So that one day I could play it back</p></li>
	<li><p>But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that</p></li>
	<li><p>Ya'll starting to creep in, everyday it's so grey and black</p></li>
	<li><p>Hope, I just need a ray of that</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for ‘em</p></li>
	<li><p>They just say it's wack</p></li>
	<li><p>They don't know what dope is</p></li>
	<li><p>And I don't know if I was awake or asleep</p></li>
	<li><p>When I wrote this</p></li>
	<li><p>All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest</p></li>
	<li><p>You picked me up, breathing life in me</p></li>
	<li><p>I owe my life to you</p></li>
	<li><p>Before the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do</p></li>
	<li><p>But it just dawned on me you lost a son</p></li>
	<li><p>See this light in you, it's dark</p></li>
	<li><p>Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you</p></li>
	<li><p>I don't think you realise what you mean to me</p></li>
	<li><p>Not the slightest clue</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause me and you were like a crew</p></li>
	<li><p>I was like your sidekick</p></li>
	<li><p>You gon' either wanna fight me when I get off this fucking mic</p></li>
	<li><p>Or you gon' hug me</p></li>
	<li><p>But I'm not an option, theres nothing else I can do cause</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm about to lose my mind</p></li>
	<li><p>You've been gone for so long</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm running out of time</p></li>
	<li><p>I need a doctor</p></li>
	<li><p>Call me a doctor</p></li>
	<li><p>I need a doctor, doctor</p></li>
	<li><p>To bring me back to life</p></li>
	<li><p>It hurts when I see you struggle</p></li>
	<li><p>You come to me with ideas</p></li>
	<li><p>You say there just pieces so I'm puzzled</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause the shit I hear is crazy</p></li>
	<li><p>But your either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more</p></li>
	<li><p>Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form</p></li>
	<li><p>Can't make a decision you keep questioning yourself</p></li>
	<li><p>Second guessing and it's almost like your begging for my help</p></li>
	<li><p>Like I'm your leader</p></li>
	<li><p>Your supposed to fucking be my mentor</p></li>
	<li><p>I can endure no more</p></li>
	<li><p>I demand you remember who you are</p></li>
	<li><p>It was you, who believed in me</p></li>
	<li><p>When everyone was telling you don't sign me</p></li>
	<li><p>Everyone at the fucking label, let's tell the truth</p></li>
	<li><p>You risked your career for me</p></li>
	<li><p>I know it as well as you</p></li>
	<li><p>Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy</p></li>
	<li><p>Dre, I'm crying in this booth</p></li>
	<li><p>You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours</p></li>
	<li><p>But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more</p></li>
	<li><p>But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me</p></li>
	<li><p>Get up Dre, I'm dying, I need you, come back for fuck's sake</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm about to lose my mind</p></li>
	<li><p>You've been gone for so long</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm running out of time</p></li>
	<li><p>I need a doctor</p></li>
	<li><p>Call me a doctor</p></li>
	<li><p>I need a doctor, doctor</p></li>

	<li><p>Bring me back to life</p></li>
	<li><p>I need a doctor, doctor</p></li>
	<li><p>To bring me back to life</p></li>
	<li><p>It literally feels like a lifetime ago</p></li>
	<li><p>But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though</p></li>
	<li><p>You walked in, yellow jump suit</p></li>
	<li><p>Whole room, cracked jokes</p></li>
	<li><p>Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke</p></li>
	<li><p>Went through friends, some of them I put on</p></li>
	<li><p>But they just left, they said they was riding to the death</p></li>
	<li><p>But where the fuck are they now</p></li>
	<li><p>Now that I need them, I don't see none of them</p></li>
	<li><p>All I see is Slim</p></li>
	<li><p>Fuck all you fair-weather friends</p></li>
	<li><p>All I need is him</p></li>
	<li><p>Fucking backstabbers</p></li>
	<li><p>When the chips were down you just laughed at us</p></li>
	<li><p>Now you bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, fuckers</p></li>
	<li><p>You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?</p></li>
	<li><p>You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass</p></li>
	<li><p>Little crack a jack beat making wack math</p></li>
	<li><p>Backwards producers, Im back bastards</p></li>
