All my life, I've been fighting a war
I can't talk to you or your friends
It's not only you
My heart jumps around when I'm alluded to
This will not do

'Cause I was raised up
To be admired, to be noticed
But when you're withdrawn
It's the closest thing
To assault when our eyes are on you
This will not do

I'm thinking glory
Lick my lips, toss my hair
And send a smile over
And the story's brand new
That I can take it from here
I'll find my own bravado

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back
It's a moon eclipsed, ohh
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this
It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
It's a marathon run
Or a mountain you scale without thinking of size

I was fighting off every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me but
I've learned not to want the quiet of the room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go
Oh whoa

It's a switch flipped
It's a pill tipped back
It's a moon eclipsed, ohh
And I can tell you that when the lights come on I'll be ready for this
It's in your blood stream
A collision of atoms that happens before your eyes
Its a marathon run
Or a mountain your scale without thinking of size

I was frightened of every little thing that I thought was out to get me down
To trip me up and laugh at me but
I've learned not to want the quiet of the room with no-one around to find me out
I want the applause, the approval, the things that make me go
Oh whoa
