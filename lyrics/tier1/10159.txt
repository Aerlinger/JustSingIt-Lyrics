Yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm the trouble starter, punkin' instigator
Oh, I'm the fear addicted, danger illustrated

I'm a firestarter, twisted firestarter
Twisted, yeah I'm twisted
You're the firestarter, twisted firestarter

I'm a firestarter, twisted firestarter

I'm the bitch you hated, filth infatuated
Wait, wait
I'm the pain you tasted, fell intoxicated
Intoxicated

I'm a firestarter, fucking firestarter
You're the firestarter, twisted firestarter
Yeah, yeah

One, two, three, four

I'm the self inflicted, mind detonator, mind detonator
Yeah, I'm the one infected, twisted animator
Twisted, fucking twisted

You're the firestarter, twisted firestarter
Twisted, yeah, you're twisted

I'm a firestarter, twisted firestarter
You're the firestarter, twisted firestarter
Yeah

[Incomprehensible]
