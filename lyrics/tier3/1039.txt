Drink up baby, stay up all night
With the things you could do, you won't but you might
The potential you'll be that you'll never see
The promises you'll only make

Drink up with me now, forget all about
The pressure of days, do what I say
And I'll make you okay, drive them away
The image is stuck in your head

People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

Drink up baby, look at the stars
Ill kiss you again between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there with your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught

Drink up one more time a I'll make you mine
Keep you apart, deep in my heart
Separate from the rest but I like you the best
Keep the things you forgot

People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still
