Know I've done wrong, left your heart torn
Is that what devils do?
Took you so low, where only fools go?
I shook the angel in you

Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I've found
There's nothing I can't do

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?

Can you love me again?

It's unforgivable, I stole and burned your soul
Is that what demons do?
They rule the worst of me, destroy everything
They bring down angels like you

Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I've found
There's nothing I can't do

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?

Can you love me again?

Oh I told you once again
Do this again, do this again, oh
I told you once again
Do this again, do this again, oh

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again

I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again

Can you love me again
