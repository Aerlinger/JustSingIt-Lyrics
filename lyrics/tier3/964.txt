Oh, joys arise
The sun has come again to hold you
Sailing out the doldrums of the [Incomprehensible]
The polyphonic prairies here, it's all around you
It's all around you, out here

And if the whole world is crashing down on you
Fall through space out of mind again
Where the emptiness we leave behind
On warm air rising
Lose all the shadows far away

The falling alcohol empire is here to hold you
Rolling out and haunted till it sinks

Little memories, marching on
Your little feet, working the machine
Will it spin? Will it soar?
My little dream, working the machine

Soar like a whale and crash and fall
And closing in on [Incomprehensible]

Little memories
Your little feet, working the machine
Will it spin? Will it sore?
My little dream, working the machine

Soar like a whale and crash and fall
And closing in on [Incomprehensible]
