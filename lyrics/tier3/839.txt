Yeah
Every hood's the same
Every hood's the same
Come on

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a god damn thang changed
It's the same ole same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein

I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day to day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay

Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower living?
The projects, thank god for Russell Simmons

Thank god for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grille
Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids
How these ghetto niggaz taken over showbiz

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

It's Boyz in the Hood, it's toys in the hood
Y'all wanna know why it's noise in the hood?
'Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood
Nigga killed a crip and a blood in the hood, for real

'Cause when niggaz get tribal
It's all about survival, nobody liable
I got caught by a five-o
Grandmama came to court with her bible

But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled

Owned by C.A., state property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Damn, I can't take the pressure
Pulled the forty-four up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming but I'm scared to toss it

Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggaz what the fuckin' boss did
The game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered

Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' 'em up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt

Ay y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
'Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Every hood's the same
Every hood's the same
Every hood's the same
Every hood's the same
Every hood's the same
Stop trippin' on it

Every hood's the same
Every hood's the same
Every hood's the same
Every hood's the same
Every hood's the same
