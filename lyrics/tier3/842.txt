This is the fuckin' shit I be talkin about
Half rappin' ass motherfuckers
You think it's a game? You think it's a fuckin' game?
Come on
Come on
What'cha really want
What'cha really want, what
What DMX?
Come on, ride or die

Ay yo, ay yo, ay yo
What's my name?
DMX and I be the best you see the rest
They lookin' like they need a rest
One more time
I'ma spit at you some shit
That's gon get at you be fuckin' with your mind
Stop talkin' shit
'Cuz you out there runnin' your mouth
And really don't know who you fuckin' with
Here we go again

How many times do I have to tell you rap niggas?
I have no friends you still actin' up
Runnin' around here like some brand new pussy
That's about to get fucked, the game don't stop
I'm still gettin' down for whatever whenever
That's why my shit is hot, can't keep it real
Now, some of us do but most of us don't
That's just how a nigga feel
I shed blood
For my people that'll keep you lookin' see through
Whenever you try to creep through

DMX, if you want it we got it
Come and get it nigga we wit it
All you gotta do is set it baby
Ryde or die
What'cha niggas want?
What'cha niggas want?

DMX
If you want it we got it
Come and get it nigga we wit it
All you gotta do is set it baby
Ryde or die
What'cha niggas want?
What'cha niggas want?

You still playin' games
You gon think it's a joke
Until they no longer remember your name
That's how we do 'em
Make cowards disappear into thin air
By puttin' shit through 'em
Never comin' back
Last time you saw that nigga
Is the last time you'll see that nigga

No more deaths
'Cause in a minute you gonna have grandma bein'
The only family member left
Bust my gun
If I got to kill a nigga but I'm always down
For the one on one
Dog for life
We gon get to the bottom of this shit if it takes all night
Stop drop
Open up shop, fake up north niggas screamin' for the cops
Ryde or die
What that mean is that I tell a nigga bye bye
And pop him in his right eye

DMX
If you want it we got it
Come and get it nigga we wit it
All you gotta do is set it baby
Ryde or die
What'cha niggas want?
What'cha niggas want?

DMX
If you want it we got it
Come and get it nigga we wit it
All you gotta do is set it baby
Ryde or die
What'cha niggas want?
What'cha niggas want?

Look at all these off brand niggas
Runnin' around yappin'
'Bout they be holdin' figgas as big as jigga's
That's that bullshit
Hope they know that around me
Talkin' about what you got will get you hit
I'm not a nice person
I mean I'd smack the shit out you twice dog
And that's before I start cursin'
I stay flippin'
One minute I'm cool the next minute, I'm up on a nigga, wippin

That's my style
I'm a cruddy nigga leave you all bloody
Nigga service with a smile
Suck my dick
And while you niggas that's been to jail before know
It's about to get thick, let's get it on baby
I'm gonna be goin' against four niggas in one
And you think you crazy?
I've lost my mind
And I'm about to make you lose yours too
From far away one time

DMX
If you want it we got it
Come and get it nigga we wit it
All you gotta do is set it baby
Ryde or die
What'cha niggas want?
What'cha niggas want?

DMX
If you want it we got it
Come and get it nigga we wit it
All you gotta do is set it baby
Ryde or die
What'cha niggas want?
What'cha niggas want?

DMX
If you want it we got it
Come and get it nigga we wit it
All you gotta do is set it baby
Ryde or die
What'cha niggas want?
What'cha niggas want?

DMX
