Put you to bed, bed, bed
Put you to bed, bed, bed

Girl, change into that Victoria Secret thing that I like
Alright, okay, tonight you're having me your way
Perfume, spray it there, put our love in the air
Now put me right next to you, finna raise the temp in the room

First rub my back like you do
Right there, uh uh, right there, uh
You touch me like you care

Now stop and let me repay you
For the week that you been through
Workin' that 9 to 5 and stayin' cute like you do
Oh oh oh

I love it, I love it, you love it, you love it
Every time, every time we touchin', we touchin'
I want it, I want it, you want it, you want it
I'll see you, see you in the mornin', in the mornin'

Wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryna' put you to bed, bed, bed
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed

Then I'ma rock your body, turn you over
Love is war, I'm your soldier
Touching you like it's our first time
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed

I'm staring at you while you sleep, irreplaceable beauty
Put my face up in your neck and breathe
Take you into my senses, wake up it's time to finish
Round two, it's round two, matter of fact, it's closer to three

She like, "How long I been sleepin'?"
Shawty kisses turn into the sweetest dreams
Like, "Give it to me" and I can feel her tell me
"My angel, this is wonderful," thanks for lettin' me bless ya
Come down, fly right, drift back into heaven, oh oh oh oh

I love it, I love it, you love it, you love it
Every time, every time we touchin', we touchin'
I want it, I want it, you want it, you want it
I'll see you, see you in the mornin', in the mornin'

Wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryna' put you to bed, bed, bed
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed

Then I'ma rock your body, turn you over
Love is war, I'm your soldier
Touching you like it's our first time
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed

Watch the sunlight peak over the horizon
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
The sun ain't the only thing that's shinin'
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Now I'ma send you out into the world with my love
Tell everybody aye, everybody aye

Wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryna' put you to bed, bed, bed
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed

Then I'ma rock your body, turn you over
Love is war, I'm your soldier
Touching you like it's our first time
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed

Watch the sunlight peak over the horizon
Like ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
The sun ain't the only thing that's shinin'
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh
Now I'ma send you out into the world with my love
Tell everybody aye, everybody aye
