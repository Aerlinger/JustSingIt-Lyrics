Jason Derulo
Check that out, what they playin'?
That's my song, that's my song
Where my drinks? I've been waiting
Much too long, much too long

And this girl in my lap
Passing out, she's a punk
The last thing on my mind is going home

From the window to the wall
This club is jumping 'til tomorrow
Is it daylight or is it nighttime?
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4
We gon' tear the club up

Ayo, me say day, oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
Yeah, so we losing control
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown

Let the club shut down, we won't go, oh, oh, oh
Burn it down to the floor oh, oh, oh
Ayo, me say day, oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home

We drink the whole bottle but it ain't over, over
Everybody jumping on the sofa, sofa
Standing on the chairs, standing on the bars
No matter day or night, I'm shining, bitch, I'm a star

From the window to the wall
This club is jumping, yeah, 'til tomorrow
Is it daylight or is it nighttime?
1 o'clock, 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock, 4
We gon' tear the club up

Ayo, me say day, oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
Yeah, so we losing control
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown

Let the club shut down, we won't go, oh, oh, oh
Burn it down to the floor oh, oh, oh
I say, ayo, me say day, oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home, Jason

I just met this sexy Haitian girl moving like a dancer
Told her and her girlfriend that's speaking my cabana
Ask me where the party's at, baby, I'm the answer
Have another drink with me, shawty, where your manners?

Take another shot, another shot, shot, shot, shot
I can make it hot, make it hot, make it hot

Ayo, me say day, oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
Yeah, so we losing control
Turn the lights low 'cause we about to get blown

Let the club shut down, we won't go, oh, oh, oh
Burn it down, to the floor, oh, oh, oh
Ayo, me say day, oh
Daylight come and we don't wanna go home
