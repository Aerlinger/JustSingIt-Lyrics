Off with your head
Dance 'til you're dead
Heads will roll, heads will roll
Heads will roll on the floor

Glitter on the wet streets
Silver over everything
The river's all wet
You're all cold

Dripping with alchemy
Shiver stop shivering
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome

The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no

The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, the girls cry out
The men cry out, oh no
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Off, off with your head
Dance, dance 'til you're dead
Heads will roll, heads will roll
Heads will roll on the floor

Looking glass, take the past
Shut your eyes, you realize
Looking glass, take the past
Shut your eyes, you realize

Glitter on the wet streets
Silver over everything
The glitter's all wet
You're all chrome, you're all chrome

Oh, oh, oh

Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead

Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead

Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
Off, off, off with your head
Dance, dance, dance 'til you're dead
