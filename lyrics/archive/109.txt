	<li><p>(Instrumental)</p></li>
	<li><p>Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity</p></li>
	<li><p>To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment</p></li>
	<li><p>Would you capture it or just let it slip</p></li>
	<li><p>Yo</p></li>
	<li><p>His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy</p></li>
	<li><p>There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti</p></li>
	<li><p>He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs</p></li>
	<li><p>But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down</p></li>
	<li><p>The whole crowd goes so loud</p></li>
	<li><p>He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out</p></li>
	<li><p>He's choking how, everybody's joking now</p></li>
	<li><p>The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah</p></li>
	<li><p>Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity</p></li>
	<li><p>Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked</p></li>
	<li><p>He's so mad, but he won't give up that</p></li>
	<li><p>Easy, no</p></li>
	<li><p>He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes</p></li>
	<li><p>It don't matter, he's dope</p></li>
	<li><p>He knows that but he's broke</p></li>
	<li><p>He's so stagnant, he knows</p></li>
	<li><p>When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's</p></li>
	<li><p>Back to the lab again, yo</p></li>
	<li><p>This whole rhapsody</p></li>
	<li><p>He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him</p></li>
	<li><p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p></li>
	<li><p>You own it, you better never let it go</p></li>
	<li><p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p></li>
	<li><p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo</p></li>
	<li><p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p></li>
	<li><p>You own it, you better never let it go</p></li>
	<li><p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p></li>
	<li><p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo</p></li>
	<li><p>(You better)</p></li>
	<li><p>The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping</p></li>
	<li><p>This world is mine for the taking</p></li>
	<li><p>Make me king, as we move toward a new world order</p></li>
	<li><p>A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem</p></li>
	<li><p>It only grows harder, only grows hotter</p></li>
	<li><p>He blows us all over these hoes is all on him</p></li>
	<li><p>Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter</p></li>
	<li><p>Lonely roads, God only knows</p></li>
	<li><p>He's grown farther from home, he's no father</p></li>
	<li><p>He goes home and barely knows his own daughter</p></li>
	<li><p>But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water</p></li>
	<li><p>His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product</p></li>
	<li><p>They moved on to the next schmoe who flows</p></li>
	<li><p>He nose dove and sold nada</p></li>
	<li><p>So the soap opera is told and unfolds</p></li>
	<li><p>I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on</p></li>
	<li><p>Da da dum da dum da da</p></li>
	<li><p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p></li>
	<li><p>You own it, you better never let it go</p></li>
	<li><p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p></li>
	<li><p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo</p></li>
	<li><p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p></li>
	<li><p>You own it, you better never let it go</p></li>
	<li><p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p></li>
	<li><p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo</p></li>
	<li><p>(You better)</p></li>
	<li><p>No more games, I'ma change what you call rage</p></li>
	<li><p>Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged</p></li>
	<li><p>I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed</p></li>
	<li><p>I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage</p></li>
	<li><p>But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher</p></li>
	<li><p>Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper</p></li>
	<li><p>All the pain inside amplified by the fact</p></li>
	<li><p>That I can't get by with my nine to five</p></li>
	<li><p>And I can't provide the right type of life for my family</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers</p></li>
	<li><p>And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life</p></li>
	<li><p>And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder</p></li>
	<li><p>Trying to feed and water my seed, plus</p></li>
	<li><p>Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna</p></li>
	<li><p>Baby mama drama's screaming on and</p></li>
	<li><p>Too much for me to wanna</p></li>
	<li><p>Stay in one spot, another day of monotony</p></li>
	<li><p>Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail</p></li>
	<li><p>I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot</p></li>
	<li><p>Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not</p></li>
	<li><p>Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go</p></li>
	<li><p>I cannot grow old in Salem's lot</p></li>
	<li><p>So here I go it's my shot</p></li>
	<li><p>Feet fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got</p></li>
	<li><p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p></li>
	<li><p>You own it, you better never let it go</p></li>
	<li><p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p></li>
	<li><p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo</p></li>
	<li><p>You better lose yourself in the music, the moment</p></li>
	<li><p>You own it, you better never let it go</p></li>
	<li><p>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow</p></li>
	<li><p>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo</p></li>
	<li><p>(You better)</p></li>
	<li><p>You can do anything you set your mind to, man</p></li>
