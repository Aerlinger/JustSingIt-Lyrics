Look, we gotta talk
Dang, I know, I know, but it's, it's just
There're some things I gotta get off my chest, alright?
Yeah, listen

Baby, come in, sit down, let's talk
I got a lot to say so I guess I'll start by
Sayin' that I love you
But you know this thing ain't been a walk in the park for us

I swear it'll only take a minute
You'll understand when I finish, yeah
And I don't want to see you cry
But I don't want to be the one to tell you a lie so

How do you let go when you
You just don't know what's on
The other side of the door
When you're walking out? Talk about it

And everything I tried to remember to say
Just went out my head
So I'ma do the best I can to get you to understand
Cause I know

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl it's not you, it's me
I kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

Girl, I know your heart is breaking
And a thousand times I found myself asking, "Why? Why?"
Why am I taking so long to say this?
But trust me, girl I never meant to crush your world and I never
Thought I would see the day we'd grow apart

And I wanna know how do you let go when you
You just don't know what's on
The other side of the door
When you're walking out? Talk about it

Girl I hope you understand what I'm tryna say
We just can't go on pretending that we get along
Girl how you not gonna see it?

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl it's not you it's me
I kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

Listen to your heart, girl you know we should be apart
Baby I, I just can't do it, I, I just can't do it
Listen to your heart, girl you know we should be apart
Baby I, I just can't do it and sometimes it makes me wanna cry

Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
(Do you hear me crying?)
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh
(Oh, oh)
Ooh ooh
(There's never a right time!)
Ooh ooh

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl it's not you it's me
I kinda gotta figure out what I need

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
Cause there's never a right time, right time to say goodbye

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But I gotta make the first move
'Cause if I don't you gonna start hating me
Cause I really don't feel the way I once felt about you
Girl it's not you it's me
I kinda gotta figure out what I need, oh

There's never a right time to say goodbye
But we know that we gotta go our separate ways
And I know it's hard but I gotta do it and it's killing me
Cause there's never a right time, right time to say
