34 Lyin' here with you so close to me* 66 It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe* 53 I'm caught up in this moment, caught up in your smile0 30 I've never opened up to anyone* 52 So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms* 51 We don't need to rush this, let's just take it slow0 * 41 Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight* 42 Just a touch of the fire burning so bright38 And I don't want to mess this thing up32 No, I don't want to push too far0 * 43 Just a shot in the dark that you just might* 46 Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life* 47 So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight0 * 41 I know that if we give this a little time* 52 It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find* 53 It's never felt so real, no, it's never felt so right0 * 41 Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight* 42 Just a touch of the fire burning so bright38 No, I don't want to mess this thing up28 I don't want to push too far0 * 43 Just a shot in the dark that you just might* 46 Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life* 47 So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight0 33 No, I don't want to say goodnight25 I know it's time to leave26 But you'll be in my dreams25 Tonight, tonight, tonight0 * 41 Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight* 42 Just a touch of the fire burning so bright38 And I don't want to mess this thing up28 I don't want to push too far0 * 43 Just a shot in the dark that you just might* 46 Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life20 So baby, I'm alright0 * 50 Oh, let's do this right with just a kiss goodnight37 With a kiss goodnight, kiss goodnight0 11 Songwriters* 69 KELLEY, CHARLES/HAYWOOD, DAVID WESLEY/SCOTT, HILLARY/DAVIDSON, DALLAS0 12 Published by* 58 Lyrics Â© Warner/Chappell Music, Inc., EMI Music Publishing0 0 0 * 61 Read more: Lady Antebellum - Just A Kiss Lyrics | MetroLyrics
