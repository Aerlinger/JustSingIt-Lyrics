I wish I could rip out a page of my memory
'Cause I put to much energy in him and me
Can't wait till I get through this phase 'cause it's killing me
Too bad we can't rewrite our own history

Such a mystery when he's here with me
It's hard to believe I'm still lonely
Chances fading now, patience running out
This ain't how it's supposed to be

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry?
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy, energy, my energy
Taking all of my energy, energy, my energy
Taking all of my energy

Seems only like yesterday, not even gravity
Could keep your feet off the ground when you were with me
How could two be as one then become so divided now?
There's no use hiding from misery, no

Such a mystery when he's here with me
It's hard to believe I'm still lonely
Chances fading now, patience running out
This ain't how it's supposed to be

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry?
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy, energy, my energy
Taking all of my energy, energy, my energy
Taking all of

Now I can feel you changing me
And I can't afford to slip much further
From the person I was meant to be, whoa
I'm not afraid to walk alone
Not giving up, I'm moving on
Before it gets too deep
'Cause you're taking all of my energy

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry?
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry?
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy, energy, my energy
Taking all of my energy, energy, my energy
Taking all of

You're killing me
You're taking all of me, yeah, oh
This love is taking all of my energy
