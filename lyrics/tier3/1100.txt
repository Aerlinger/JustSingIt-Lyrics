Oh yeah,
They tell me I'm a bad boy(anthony)
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

Look at her go on the dancefloor
She's amazing on the dancefloor
When she moves, girl I want more
Keep it going girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying:

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, go little bad girl

Oh yeah,
They tell me I'm a bad boy
All the ladies look at me and act coy
I just like to put my hands up in the air
I want that girl dancing over there

Shaking her ass from the left to the right
Moving it round just the way that I like
I wanna see her move like a movie on flight
She got it how I want it and I want it all night

Look at her go on the dancefloor
She's amazing on the dancefloor
When she moves, girl I want more
Keep it going girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, go little bad girl

She got my heart jumpin'
And my adrenalin pumpin' and gunnin'
Like ain't nobody ever seen (seen seen seen)
As a matter of fact I've seen this woman all up in my dreams
Whippin' and flippin' and stackin' and slappin'
I'm attacking after she back it up and make it DROP (Drop drop drop)
After I met her, I tell her David Guetta is on the track
Baby girl don't STOP (Stop Stop Stop)
Keep it going you never know when somebody gonna throw couple dollars
Got a pocket full of hundred dollars bills
Ludacris, Mr. Make-A-Woman-Holla SING (Sing Sing Sing)
And every night on the floor putting on a SHOW (Show Show Show)
Everybody in the club
Here's a little something you should know

Look at her go on the dancefloor
She's amazing on the dancefloor
When she moves, girl I want more
Keep it going girl, like I got an encore
You got me saying

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, go little bad girl

Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, little bad girl
Go little bad girl, go little bad girl
