Ooh, yeah, ooh, remember, ooh, I remember
And I wanna know where were you when I said I loved you?
And where were you when I cried at night?
Waitin' up, couldn't sleep without you
Thinkin' of all the times we shared

I remember when my heart broke
I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely

I remember when I walked out
I remember when I screamed I hated you
But somehow deep inside still lovin' you
Sad and lonely

No one knew all the pain I went through
All the love I saved deep in my heart for you
Didn't know, where I would go, where I would be
But you made me leave
And plus my heart it just, it just kept tellin' me so, oh

I remember when my heart broke
I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely

I remember when I walked out
I remember when I said I hated you
But somehow deep inside still lovin' you
So sad and lonely

There was nowhere else to go, oh
Nobody else to turn to, no
For the rest of my life, I promise myself
I will love me first, then you and me

I remember when my heart broke
I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
I was sad and lonely

I remember when I walked out
I remember when I said I hated you
But some how deep inside still lovin' you
Sad and lonely

I remember when I walked out
I remember when I gave up lovin' you
My heart couldn't take no more of you
So sad and lonely, hey

I remember when I stormed out
I remember when I gave up lovin' you
I was sad and lonely
