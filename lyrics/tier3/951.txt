Over closer through
Figures collide
Open eyes to awake
Wilder through the better days
Go silent
See them running around
Changing the rain
Gold is colder than ice
More is more than you can take
Open your eyes
Oh, out here
Dont you ever know?
Oh, out here
Dont you ever know, better?
Now among the wild hills
Open they lie
For diamond tears we could ride
If only youd get back in time
Open your eyes
Oh, out here
Dont you ever know?
Oh, out here
Dont you ever know? (you never know)
I can only happen
I and I want it back again
I could only happen
I and Id want you back again
If only youd get back in time
Open your eyes
Open your eyes
