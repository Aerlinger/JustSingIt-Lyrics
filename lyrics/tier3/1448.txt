Here come old flattop
He come groovin' up slowly
He got joo-joo eyeball
He one holy roller
He got hair down to his knees
Got to be a joker
He just do what he please

He wear no shoeshine
He got toe jam football
He got monkey finger
He shoot Coca Cola
He say I know you, you know me
One thing I can tell you is
You got to be free

Come together, right now
Over me

He bag production
He got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard
He one spinal clacker
He got feet down below his knees
Hold you in his arms till
You can feel his disease

Come together, right now
Over me

He roller coaster
He got early warning
He got muddy water
He one mojo filter
He say one and one and one is three
Got to be good looking
'Cause he's so hard to see

Come together, right now
Over me

Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah

Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah uh
Come together, yeah
Come together, yeah

Songwriters
Lennon, John / Mccartney, Paul James
