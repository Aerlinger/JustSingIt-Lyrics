I only miss you when I'm breathing
I only need you when my heart is beating
You are the color that I'm bleeding
I only miss you when I'm breathing

This ain't no ordinary feeling
You are the only thing that I believe in
I know you're coming back to me and
I will be waiting here for you til the end

I only miss you when I'm breathing!
I only miss you when I'm breathing!

Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive

I only miss you when I'm breathing!

Ay ay ay ay ay ay ya
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ya

I see pictures of you leaving
On these four walls, and on the ceiling
Give you a kiss, but I am dreaming
These crazy thoughts are so deceiving
You are the drug, I am needing
Paradise that I'm still seeking

I'm still alive, hope there's a reason
Can't move my lips, but my heart is screaming

I only miss you when I'm breathing!
I only miss you when I'm breathing!

Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive

I only miss you when I'm breathing!

Oh,oh,oh breathing!

Ay ay ay ay ay ay ya
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ya

Oh baby, I only miss you when I...
I'm screaming out your name, but you don't answer me
I know I kissed your face, is this my fantasy?
Sound the alarm, tell everyone that I only miss you

I only miss you when I'm breathing!
I only miss you when I'm breathing!

Without your love, don't know how I survive
It's you, it's you that's keeping me alive

I only miss you when I'm breathing!

I only miss you when I'm breathing...
