Never really said too much
Afraid it wouldnt be enough
Just try to keep my spirits up
When theres no point in grieving

Doesnt matter anyway
Words can never make me stay
Words will never take my place
When you know Im leaving

Try to leave a light on when Im gone
Something I rely on to get home
One I can feel at night, a naked light
A fire to keep me warm

Try to leave a light on when Im gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when its late at night you can look inside
You wont feel so alone

You know weve been down that road
What seems a thousand times before
My back to a closing door
And my eyes to the seasons

That roll out underneath my heels
And you dont know how bad it feels
To leave the only one
That I have ever believed in

Try to leave a light on when Im gone
Something I rely on to get home
One I can feel at night, a naked light
A fire to keep me warm

Try to leave a light on when Im gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when its late at night you can look inside
You wont feel so alone, ooh yeah!

Sometimes it feels like we've run out of luck
When the signal keeps on breaking up
When the wires cross in my brain
Youll start my heart again when I come along, yeah

Try to leave a light on when Im gone
Something I rely on to get home
One I can feel at night, a naked light
A fire to keep me warm

Try to leave a light on when Im gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when its late at night you can look inside
You wont feel so alone

Try to leave a light on when Im gone
Even in the daylight, shine on
And when its late at night you can look inside
You wont feel so alone
