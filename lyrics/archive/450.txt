Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dyin' to tell you
Anything you wanna hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week

Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost
But you're just a line in a song
(notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart and break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it

Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me
I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans

Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song
(Notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song)

Drop a heart and break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it

We're goin' down, down, in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it

Down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it

We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
(Take aim at myself)
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
(Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet
(Take aim at myself)
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it

We're going down, down
(Down, down)
Down, down
(Down, down)
We're going down, down
(Down, down)
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it

We're goin' down, down in an earlier round
(Take aim at myself)
And sugar, we're goin' down swingin'
(Take back what you said)
I'll be your number one with a bullet
(Take aim at myself)
A loaded gun complex, cock it and pull it
