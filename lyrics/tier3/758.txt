You put in over time, over night, doing everything I like, go so right, yeah
You hold me close, squeeze me tight, look me deep inside my eyes, baby ooh I love it
But nothing can compare to when you kiss me there
And I can't lie when I lie I your arms baby I feel so sexy

So boy just take your time, send chills down my spine
You're one of a kind, that's why I gotta make you mine
Boy you turn me on, got me feeling hot
Now I'm really goin'

I like, I like, I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you gave it to me slow
Baby just like that

I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you gave it to me slow
Baby just like that

Yeah
Baby get a little rough that's okay
Baby go ahead do your thang, ride away
And I love it when we misbehave
Me and you together babe, we can do everything
Boy, if somebody could see the way you kiss on me
Oh they won't believe it, 'cause even I don't believe it
But I love the way I'm feelin'

So boy just take your time, send chills down my spine
You're one of a kind, that's why I gotta make you mine
Boy you turn me on, got me feeling hot
Now I'm really goin'

I like, I like, I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you gave it to me slow
Baby just like that

I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you gave it to me slow
Baby just like that

Speed it up, heat it up, let it go, let it go, let it go
Till I get, get enough, you never know, never know, never know
I like that there, yeah that there
A little more to the left, yeah right there

So boy just take your time, send chills down my spine
You're one of a kind, that's why I gotta make you mine
Boy you turn me on, got me feeling hot
Now I'm really goin'

I like, I like, I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you gave it to me slow
Baby just like that

I like my kisses down low
Makes me arch my back
When you gave it to me slow
Baby just like that
