This world has nothing for me,
This life is not my own,
I know you go before me
and I am not alone
This mountain rises higher,
The way seems so unclear,
but I know that you go with me,
So I will never fear

I will trust in You

What ever will come our way,
Through Fire or Pouring Rain,
we won't be shaken,
no we won't be shaken
What ever tomorrow brings,
together we'll rise and see,
That we won't be shaken,
No we won't be shaken
(oh, oh, oh, oh , oh)
(oh, oh, oh, oh , oh)
(oh, oh, oh, oh , oh)
No We won't be shaken

You know my every longing
you've heard my every prayer
you've held me in my weakness
'Cos you were always there
So I'll stand in full surrender
it's your way and not my own
my mind is set on nothing less
But you and you alone

I will not be moved (oh)

What ever will come our way,
Through Fire or Pouring Rain,
we won't be shaken,
no we won't be shaken
What ever tomorrow brings,
together we'll rise and see,
That we won't be shaken,
No we won't be shaken

We will trust in you,
we will not be moved
We will trust in you
and we won't be shaken
We will trust in you,
we will not be moved
We will trust in you
(yeah) we won't be shaken
We will trust in you,
we will not be moved
We will trust in you
and we won't be shaken
No we won't be shaken

What ever will come our way,
Through Fire or Pouring Rain,
no we won't be shaken,
no we won't be shaken
What ever tomorrow brings,
together we'll rise and see,
That we won't be shaken,
No we won't be shaken
(oh, oh, oh, oh , oh)
(oh, oh, oh, oh , oh)
(oh, oh, oh, oh , oh)
No We won't be shaken
(oh, oh, oh, oh , oh)
(oh, oh, oh, oh , oh)
(oh, oh, oh, oh , oh)
No We won't be shaken
