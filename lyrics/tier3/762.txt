Oooh, make love to me
One more time
Before you go away
Why cant you stay?
Oooh, my love
Come home to me
Just for a while
Ill leave this place
Why cant you stay?
Dont run away
Dont slip away my dear
Dont run away
Dont slip away my dear
Dont run away
The song is gone
Fell into the fall
But I dont want it this way
Why cant you stay?

Dont run away
Dont slip away my dear
Dont run away
Dont slip away my dear
Dont run away
Ohh ohh
That should be worse
That should be worse that explain away
But Ill talk time and twisted
Dont run away
Dont slip away my dear
