[Chorus]
Don't say a word just turn around and let me see
Girl you got something special something special for me
It's way too many suckers in the VIP
Valet got my car upfront
Tell me do you wanna kick it in the backseat?
I wanna get beside ya
In the backseat
So I can be your backseat driver
In the backseat
I wanna get beside ya
In the backseat
So I can be your backseat driver

[Verse 1 - Ben J]
You see them girls with them high heels they got this party poppin

[Chours]
Don't say a word just turn around and let me see

[Verse 2 - Legacy]

Hey you got more of that, you sayin shy swag
Until you get it low quit playin with your fine @#$%

Let's do like Fishburg dancin and shake this spot quick
Oh you a good girl it's cool I play pretend too

So I can be your backseat driver

I met a group girls in the Escalade

Met, met a group of girls in the Escalade
They came with you and left with me

I met a group girls in the Escalade

Met, met a group of girls in the Escalade
They came with you and left with me

[Chorus]
Don't say a word just turn around and let me see

It's way too many suckers in the VIP
Valet got my car upfront
Tell me do you wanna kick it in the backseat
I wanna get beside ya

So I can be your backseat driver
In the backseat
I wanna get beside ya
In the backseat
So I can be your backseat driver
