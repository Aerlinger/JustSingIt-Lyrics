Do You
Do you like love?
Have you ever felt alone?
Do you still believe in love?
But do you like love, do you like love
Well me too, me too, me too babe
Me too, me too
Do you like hugs, Do you like love
Well me too, me too, me too babe
Me too, me too
Its what we gonna do,

What about matinee movies, and pointless secrets
Midnight summers, and private beaches
Rock, paper scissors
Wait! Best out of 3
Mama said the greatest things in life are free

What about lust?
What about trust ?
What about fun? She said you know that I do
Oh you do baby, hope you do now
You do, do, do, do

Do you like love, do you like love
Well me too, me too, me too babe
Me too, me too
Do you like us do you like us
Well me too, me too, me too babe
Me too, me too
Its what we gonna do,

Tonight, so lets dance a little harder
Till I feel like I know,
All the things

But do you like love, do you like love
Well me too, me too, me too babe
Me too, me too
Do you like hugs do you like hugs
Feel like we got so much in common now
Right about now baby
Me too, me too
Its what we gonna do,
Its you and me tonight
Tonight, you and me tonight
Tonight, you and me tonight
You and me yeah, tonight
You and me tonight, oh
Feel like I've known you for so long
Right about now baby, yeah, yeah
I wanna do you like love tonight
Wanna do you like love, yeah
