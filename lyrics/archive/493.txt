Na na na na, na na, na na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na, na na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na, na na

If I was a rich girl, na na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na na na
See, I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me, my cash flow would never ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl

Think what that money could bring
I'd buy everything
Clean out Vivienne Westwood
In my Galliano gown

No, I wouldn't just have one hood
A Hollywood mansion if I could
Please book me first class to
My fancy house in London town

All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
All the riches, baby, won't bring what your love can bring
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
Don't need no other baby, your lovin' is better than gold, and I know

If I was rich girl, na na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na na na
See, I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me, my cash flow would never ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl

I'd get me four Harajuku girls to
Inspire me, and they'd come to my rescue
I'd dress them wicked, I'd give them names
Love, Angel, Music, Baby, hurry up and come and save me

All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
All the riches, baby, won't bring what your love can bring
All the riches, baby, won't mean anything
Don't need no other baby, your lovin' is better than gold, and I know

Come together all over the world
From the hoods of Japan, Harajuku girls
What? It's all love, what? Give it up
What? Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter, what?

Come together all over the world
From the hoods of Japan, Harajuku girls
What? It's all love, what? Give it up
What? Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter
Shouldn't matter, shouldn't matter

What happened to my life? Turned upside down
Chicks that blew ya mind, ding, it's the second round
Original track and ting, mmm
You know you can't buy these things, no

See Stefani and her L.A.M.B.
I rock the fetish, people, you know who I am
Yes ma'am, we got the style that's wicked, I hope you can all keep up
We climbed all the way from the bottom to the top
Now we ain't gettin' nothin' but love

If I was rich girl, na na, na na, na na, na na na na, na na, na na na
See, I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl
No man could test me, impress me, my cash flow would never ever end
'Cause I'd have all the money in the world if I was a wealthy girl

Na na na na, na na, na na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na, na na

Na na na na, na na, na na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na, na na

Na na na na, na na, na na na na, na na
Na na na na, na na na, na na na, na na
