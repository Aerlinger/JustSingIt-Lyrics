[Hook]
Yeah, I see you waitin over there
See you jockin over there
See you lookin at my girl over here
Why you worried bout this girl over here?
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
Turn my head and hey
I see you waitin over there
I see you jockin over there
Thinkin bout your own life
Why you talkin bout the young, you dig?
Im just doin my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know and they think they know
The deal for real
Im just doin my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know, and they think they know
The deal for real
Im just doin my thang, if you know what I mean, yo

[Verse 1]
I dont love who I am so Im workin on a fix
I dont need a bitch trying to tear my mind on my grip
If I had one wish itd be to have more wishes, duh
Fuck tryna make it rhyme throw them stones, with your bitch ass
Cutting me deep and even though I bleed I stand alone
Alone Ill be, heart of a lion still shining on your sucka ass
Work it, work it, work it, for inner peace
Fightin for the freedom of my soul, I can hear the speech
Yeah I mumble while Im trippin on so many pills
Hah, they figured that, they know Im ill

[Hook]
Yeah, I see you waitin over there
See you jockin over there
See you lookin at my girl over here
Why you worried bout this girl over here?
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
Turn my head and hey
I see you waitin over there
I see you jockin over there
Thinkin bout your own life
Why you talkin bout the young, you dig?
Im just doin my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know and they think they know
The deal for real
Im just doin my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know, and they think they know
The deal for real
Im just doin my thang, if you know what I mean, yo
