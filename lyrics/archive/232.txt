	<li><p>If I was a success, oh, would you be satisfied?</p></li>
	<li><p>I need a paramedic, girl, I'm feelin' paralyzed</p></li>
	<li><p>If I could choose, you would always be a friend of me</p></li>

	<li><p>How could somethin' so familiar be so strange?</p></li>
	<li><p>Closest friends gettin' strange when your status change</p></li>
	<li><p>Why is it my mistake that where I am and where you at</p></li>
	<li><p>And my homeboy Larry Live is the only one that have my back?</p></li>
	<li><p>We were the perfect pair, and now it seem that we don't match</p></li>

	<li><p>Uh, I am the topic of conversation, this a celebration</p></li>
	<li><p>Let's toast to the fact that I moved out my momma's basement</p></li>
	<li><p>To a condo downtown 'cause it's all about location</p></li>
	<li><p>I sit and drink wine and watch Californication of life</p></li>
	<li><p>You shoulda been here to kick it with me</p></li>
	<li><p>We coulda split this whole thing up 50/50</p></li>
	<li><p>But now I'm at the 40/40 getting bitches tipsy</p></li>

	<li><p>To me and Dwayne Carter putting out the hardest shit</p></li>
	<li><p>I should wanna go back to the one I started with</p></li>
	<li><p>But I'm addicted to this life, it's gon' be hard to quit</p></li>
	<li><p>Yeah, just ask me how things are coming along</p></li>
	<li><p>You can tell me that you never heard none of my songs</p></li>
	<li><p>Long as you end up saying one day you plan to listen</p></li>
	<li><p>'Cause what's a star when its most important fan is missing?</p></li>
	<li><p>This shit was all I knew</p></li>
