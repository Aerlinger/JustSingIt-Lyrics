I left my girl back home, I don't love her no more
And she'll never f*cking know that, these f*cking eyes that I'm staring at
Let me see that ass, look at all this cash
And I've emptied out my cards too
Now I'm f*cking leaning on that

Bring your love baby I can bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby I can bring my pain
I got my heart right here, I got my scars right here
Bring the cups baby I can bring the drink
Bring your body baby I can bring you fame

That's my motherf*cking word too
Just let me motherf*cking love you

Listen ma, I'll give you all I got
Give me all for this, I need confidence in myself
Listen ma, I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself
Oh, oh, oh
Woah
So tell me you love me
Only for tonight
Only for tonight
Even though you don't love me
Oh, oh
Just tell me you love me
I'll give you all of me, I'll give you all of me
Even though you don't love me

Let me see you dance
I love to watch you dance
Take you down another level
Get you dancing with the devil
Take a shot of this
But I'm warning you
I'm on that shit that you can't smell baby
So, put down your perfume

Bring your love baby I can bring my shame
Bring the drugs baby I can bring my pain
I got my heart right here, I got my scars right here
Bring the cups baby I can bring the drink
Bring your body baby I can bring you fame

That's my motherf*cking word too
So let me motherf*cking love you

Listen ma, I'll give you all I got
Give me all of this, I Need confidence in myself
Listen ma, I'll give you all of me
Give me all of it, I need all of it to myself
I need all of it
So tell me you love me
Only for tonight
Only for tonight
Even though you don't love me
Oh, oh
Just tell me you love me
I'll give you all of me, I'll give you all of me
Even though you don't love me
