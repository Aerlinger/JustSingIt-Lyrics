We are the crowd
We're co-coming out
Got my flash on, it's true
Need that picture of you

It's so magical
We'd be so fantastico

Leather and jeans
Garage glamorous
Not sure what it means
But this photo of us

It don't have a price
Ready for those flashing lights
'Cause you know that, baby, I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be
Papa-paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop
Until that boy is mine

Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

I'll be your girl
Backstage at your show
Velvet ropes and guitars
Yeah, 'cause your my rockstar

In between the sets
Eyeliner and cigarettes

Shadow is burnt
Yellow dance in return
My lashes are dry
Purple teardrops I cry

It don't have a price
Loving you is cherry pie
'Cause you know that, baby, I

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be
Papa-paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop
Until that boy is mine

Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

(Real good)
We're dancin' in the studio
(Snap, snap)
To that shit on the radio

(Don't stop)
For anyone
We're plastic but
We'll still have fun

I'm your biggest fan
I'll follow you until you love me
Papa-paparazzi

Baby, there's no other superstar
You know that I'll be
Papa-paparazzi

Promise I'll be kind
But I won't stop
Until that boy is mine

Baby, you'll be famous
Chase you down until you love me
Papa-paparazzi
