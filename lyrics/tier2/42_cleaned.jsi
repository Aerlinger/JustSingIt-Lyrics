You don't get them girls loose loose
You don't get the world loose loose
You don't get money move, move
But I do, I do
You don't get them girls loose loose
You don't get the world loose loose
You don't get money move, move
But I do, I do

I say y'all having a good time out there

Yeah, yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah, que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party

I'm running through the world like I'm running back
Scarface, world's mine, running back
30,000 people in here see me
80,000 in London, Wembley
90,000 people in Morocco, and I'm just getting warmed up, papo
Catch me with Red One in Stockholm, Beirut, cafe getting my drink on, Voli
Wow all the pretty women here, the hooka
All of them sweet, azucar, azucar!
Dale disfruta

They can't, they won't, they never will, stop the party
They can't, they won't, they never will, stop the party

I say y'all having a good time out there

Yeah, yeah, yeah que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party!
Yeah, yeah, yeah que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party!

I'm from the city, with a stretch, and a slinky
And now I'm doing shows in Helsinki
I know what ya'll thinking, you're thinking, that you can out think me, but you can't frankly
I'm out for the benji's, frankies, (C-notes)
Just cause you ain't me, don't hate me
As a matter fact you should thank me
Even if you don't, you're welcome Yankees

Who got the keys of the world, now? Yours truly!
They can't,they won't,they never will,stop the party
They can't, they won't, they never will, stop the party
They can't, they won't, they never will, stop the party
The party the party
I say y'all having a good time out there

Yeah, yeah, yeah que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party!
Yeah, yeah, yeah que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party!

I'm to give it to ya, ah ah
Now give it to me, ah ah
I'm to give it to ya, ah ah
Now give it to me, ah ah
I'm to give it to ya, ah ah
Now give it to me, ah ah
Get funky, get funky
Now stop!

I say y'all having a good time out there

Yeah, yeah, yeah que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party!
Yeah, yeah, yeah que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party!

Yeah, yeah, yeah que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party
Yeah, yeah, yeah que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party

Yeah, yeah, yeah que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party!
Yeah, yeah, yeah que no pare la fiesta
Don't stop the party!
