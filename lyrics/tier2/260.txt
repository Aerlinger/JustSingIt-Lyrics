Feel it comin' in the air
And the screams from everywhere
I'm addicted to the thrill
It's a dangerous love affair

Can't be scared when it goes down
Got a problem, tell me now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight

Is who's gonna run this town tonight
We gonna run this town

We are, ya I said it, we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything

And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I'd get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper

I'm a couple bands down, and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave the other grip, I lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah I'm talkin' five comma, six zeros, dot zeros, here it go
Back to runnin' circles 'round niggas, now we squared up
Hold up

Life's a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain

Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
(Is who's gonna run this town tonight)

We are, ya, I said it, we are
You can call me Caesar in a dark CSAR
Please follow the leader, so Eric B. we are
Microphone fiend, it's the return of the god, peace god

Uh, uh, and ain't nobody fresher
I'm in Mason, uh, Martin Margiela
On the table screamin' fuck the other side, they jealous
We got a banquet full of broads, they got a table full of fellas

And they ain't spending no cake
They should throw they hand in, 'cause they ain't got no spades
My whole team got dough
So my Bankhead is lookin' like millionaires' 'fro

Life's a game but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thing
Walkin' tall against the rain

Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don't give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gonna run this town tonight

Hey, hey
Hey, hey
(Is who's gonna run this town tonight)

It's crazy how you can go from being Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick, no homo
I bought my whole family whips, no Volvos
Next time I'm in church, please no photos

Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This a fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fucking Rav-4?

But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I could spend my whole life "Good Will Hunting"
Only good gon' come is as good when I'm coming

She got a ass that'll swallow up a g-string
And up top, uh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct

We give a damn about the drama that you do bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to drop some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?

What's that 'Ye? Baby, these heels
Is that a May, what, baby, these wheels
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh, now you know how we feel

Wassup!
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Wassup!
Hey, hey, hey
We gonna run this town tonight
Wassup!
