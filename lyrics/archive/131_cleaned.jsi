Cut the music up, little louder
yeah
You had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you're in a corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there
It's hard not to stare, the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Never had a love
When you was just a youngin' your looks were so precious
But now your grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can't have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It's seems like you came back ten times over
Now you're sitting here in this @#$% corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulders
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you're in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
Oh, you had a lot of dreams that transformed to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn't your fault
Wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me
Be the one listenin'
But I admire your popping bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don't be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
Oh,
See I just want you to know
That you deserve the best
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
Yeah
And I want you to know, you're far from the usual
Far from the usual
You see you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love
See you had a lot of crooks tryna steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn't ever figure out
How to love
How to love
Yeah, see you had a lot of moments that didn't last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love
How to love, mmmm.
