Hit me!

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath

Ooh, I put it right there, made it easy for you to get to
Now you wanna act like you don't know what to do
After I gone done everything that you asked me
Grabbed you, grind you, liked you, tried you
Moved so fast, baby, now I can't find you

Ooh, I'm startin' to believe that I'm way too much for you
All that talk but it seems like I can't come through
All them lines like you could satisfy me
Now I see where believing you got me
Gave you the wheel but you can't drive me

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath

Ooh, two things I don't like when I'm tryna get my groove
Is a partner that meets me only halfway and just can't prove
Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
Need a lifeguard and I need protection
To put it on me deep in the right direction

Ooh, you understand the facts that I'm tryna get to you
You're movin' so slow like you just don't have a clue
Didn't momma teach you to give affection?
Learn the difference from a man and an adolescent?
It ain't you boo, so get ta steppin'

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath

If you can't make me say, ooh
Like the beat of this drum
Why you ask for some?
You ain't really want none

If you can't make me say, ooh
Like the beat of this groove
You don't have no business in this
Here's your papers, baby, you are dismissed

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my

Can you keep up?
Baby boy, make me lose my breath
Bring the noise, make me lose my breath
Hit me hard, make me lose my breath
