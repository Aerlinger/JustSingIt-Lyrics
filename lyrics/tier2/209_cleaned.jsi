Hey, Jay Sean, Sean Paul
Yeah, Lil Jon
This one right here is for all the ladies
Ladies, who want to take it back
Holler at them Jay

I've been thinking about you
And how we used to
Be then back when we didn't have to live
We could start again

There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay

If it's alright with you
Then it's alright with me
Baby, let's take this time
Let's make new memories

Do you remember, do you remember
Do you remember all of the times we had?
Do you remember, do you remember
Do you remember all of the times we had?

Let's bring it back
(Bring it back)
Let's bring it back
(Bring it back)
Let's bring it back
(Bring it back)
Let's bring it back
(Bring it back)
Let's bring it back

Yo Jay, sing to these ladies

So long since you've been missing
It's good to see you again
How you, how you doing?
And how about we don't let this happen again

There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay

If it's alright with you
Then it's alright with me
Baby, let's take this time
Let's make new memories

Do you remember, do you remember
Do you remember all of the times we had?
Do you remember, do you remember
Do you remember all of the times we had?

Let's bring it back
(Bring it back)
Let's bring it back
(Bring it back)
Let's bring it back
(Bring it back)
Let's bring it back
(Bring it back)

Yo, hey girl, yo

Bring it back to the time when you and me had just begun
When I was still your number one
Well, it might seem far-fetched, baby girl
But it can be done

I've got this feeling, fire blazing
And it's hot just like the sun
Know you feel it too, my girl
Just free it up, may the good vibes run

Girl, take a sip of the Champagne
Take a lil trip down my lane, my girl
While you know every night you'll feel alright
Look I tell you this girl out of my world

Don't change, I'mma rearrange, my girl
I'mma tell you straight, this out of my world
How many years do you want come kiss?
This I know you miss this, that's what I heard

That's what I heard, that's what I heard, word, girl

There's nothing left to say
Don't waste another day
Just you and me tonight
Everything will be okay

If it's alright with you
Then it's alright with me
Baby, let's take this time
Let's make new memories

Do you remember, do you remember
Do you remember all of the times we had?
Do you remember, do you remember
Do you remember all of the times we had?

Let's bring it back
(Let's bring it back)
Let's bring it back
(Bring it back)
Let's bring it back
(Let's bring it back)
Let's bring it back
(Oh)
Let's bring it back
