County Road 233 under my feet
Nothin' on this white rock but a little ol' me
I got two miles 'til he makes bail
And if I'm right we're headed straight for hell

I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
He wants a fight, well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet

Slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm gonna show him what a little girl's a made of
Gunpowder and lead

Well, it's half past ten, another six pack in
I can feel the rumble like the cold black wind
He pulls in the drive, gravel flies
But he don't know what's waitin' here this time

Hey, I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
He wants a fight, well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet

Slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm gonna show him what a little girl's made of
Gunpowder and lead

His fist is big but my gun's bigger
He'll find out when I pull the trigger

I'm goin' home, gonna load my shotgun
Wait by the door and light a cigarette
He wants a fight, well now he's got one
And he ain't seen me crazy yet

Slapped my face and he shook me like a rag doll
Don't that sound like a real man
I'm gonna show him what a little girl's made of
Gunpowder and, gunpowder and lead
Gunpowder and lead, hey!
