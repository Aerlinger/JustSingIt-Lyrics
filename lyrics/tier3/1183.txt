Scotty doesn't know that Fiona and me
Do it in my van every Sunday
She tells him she's in church but she doesn't go
Still she's on her knees and Scotty doesn't know!

Oh Scotty doesn't know!
So don't tell Scotty!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
So don't tell Scotty!

Fiona says she's out shopping
But she's under me
And I'm not stopping

Because Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
So don't tell Scotty!
Scotty doesn't know!
Don't tell Scotty!

I can't believe he's so trusting
While I'm right behind you thrusting
Fiona's got him on the phone
And she's trying not to moan
It's a three-way call and he knows nothing, nothing!

Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
So don't tell Scotty!
Cause Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
So don't tell Scotty!

We'll put on a show!
Everyone will go!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!

The parkin' lot, why not?
It's so cool when you're on top!
His front lawn in the snow
Life is so hard because Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!

I did her on his birthday

Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
So don't tell Scotty!
Scotty doesn't know!

Scotty will know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty's gotta know!
I'm gonna tell Scotty!
Gonna tell him myself!

Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty has to
Scotty has to
Scotty has to go!

Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
(So don't tell Scotty!)
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
(So don't tell Scotty!)
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't, Scotty doesn't
Scotty doesn't

(Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!)

(Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!
Scotty's gotta go!)
