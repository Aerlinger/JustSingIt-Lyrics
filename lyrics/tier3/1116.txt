(Yeah I used to build you up) to watch you tear me down
(I'd always let you in) and let you kick me out
(You used to make me laugh) but now you make me sick
(Thought you were just so dope) but now you're full of it

'Cause all day and all night
I would take your shh' (your what?)
Yeah, all day and all night, but I'm o-over it

It's all good yeah, baby, it's alright
I release you tonight
It's all cool, no need to think twice
I release you, goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Yeah you said you need your space, how 'bout a thousand miles?
How 'bout I change the locks, in case you change your mind?
I waited patiently for you to come around
I used to hold it in, but now I'm freakin' out

'Cause all day and all night
I would take your shh' (your what?)
Yeah, all day and all night, but I'm over it

It's all good
Yeah, baby, it's alright
I release you tonight
It's all cool, no need to think twice
I release you, goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye

Yeah hey baby, I, I know I'm good without you
Hey baby, I (Ooh)
Hey baby, I, I'll never think about you
Hey baby, I (Ooh)

Release you, yeah
'Cause all day, and all night, yeah

It's all good yeah, baby, it's alright
I release you tonight
It's all cool, no need to think twice
I release you, goodbye

It's all good yeah, baby, it's alright
I release you tonight
It's all cool, no need to think twice
I release you tonight, yeah

Hey baby, I, I know I'm good without you
Hey baby, I (Ooh)
Hey baby I, I'll never think about you
Hey baby, I (Ooh)
