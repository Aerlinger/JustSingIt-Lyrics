Even though I'm not your man, you're not my girl
Ima call you my shawty
Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad
I beat his ass for my shawty

And we ain't did nothin that we ain't supposed to do
'Cause you my shawty, whoa
Baby girl you know I be home
Keep me on the ringtone shawty
Sing it to me girl

Soon as I seen her, shit, told her Id pay for it
Lil mama the baddest thing 'round and she already know it
I pointed at the donk and told her this supposed to be yours
Showed her a couple stacks and told her Id let her blow it

The hottest nig' in this city baby you can't ignore it
I showed her I was the real nig' and she went for it
First time I called her, shit, she aint even know how to throw it back
Now she a animal, I got her sex game right

I taught her how to talk to me while she take pipe
And opened her up and showed her what a real nigga like
I told her I don't usually do this, I don't fuck on the first night
'Cause after I beat ya baby I'm liable to fuck up ya whole life

I got her trained and now she suck me with ice
I call her "my lil' bust it baby" cause she keep it tight
Whenever I tell her to bust, aint gotta tell her twice
Whenever I wanna get off she know how to get me right

Even though I'm not your man, you're not my girl
Ima call you my shawty
'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad
I beat his ass for my shawty

And we aint did nothin' that we ain't supposed to do
'Cause you my shawty, whoa
Baby girl you know I be home
Keep me on the ringtone shawty
Sing it to me girl

Whoa w-w-whoa, whoa whoa w-w-whoa
Whoa whoa w-w-whoa shawty
Whoa w-w-whoa, whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa w-w-whoa shawty

I love to show her off 'cause all the dope boys want her
Know why they wanna beat bad, look at all that ass on her
Look how that pussy sit up in them shorts, you gotta want her
Love the way she act like she bowlegged and bend the corner

She proud to be fuckin me 'cause I'm stuntin on 'em
It feels good to be fuckin a real nigga, don't it?
Aint called her in 2 days, gotta let her mind wonder
But when she miss me, she call to tell me to jump on her

Thats why I don't mind breakin her off 'cause she aint with the drama
If you done ripped her before, you know how to cuff lil' mama
You know she gotta be somethin 'cause I done beat her under
Baby snatchin now now I'm tellin ya, I promise

I exposed her to real and now she hate lame
Member she used to run from me, now she like Pain
She called me sometimes just to ask is it her thing
Ever since I ran up in shawty she ain't been the same

Even though I'm not your man, you're not my girl
Ima call you my shawty
'Cause I can't stand to see you treated bad
I beat his ass for my shawty

And we aint did nothin' that we ain't supposed to do
'Cause you my shawty, whoa
Baby girl you know I be home
Keep me on the ringtone shawty
Sing it to me girl

Whoa w-w-whoa, whoa whoa w-w-whoa
Whoa whoa w-w-whoa shawty
Whoa w-w-whoa, whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa
Whoa w-w-whoa shawty, w-w-w-whoa oh!
