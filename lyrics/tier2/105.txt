I cut my bangs with some rusty kitchen scissors
I screamed his name 'till the neighbors called the cops
I numbe the pain at the expense of my liver the pain at the expense of my liver
I don't know what I did next all I know, I couldn't stop

Word got around to the barflies and the baptists
My mama's phone started ringin' off the hook
I can hear her now sayin' she ain't gonna have it
Don't matter how you feel, it only matters how you look

Go and fix you make-up, girl it's just a breakup
Run and hide you crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart, but this ain't my Mama's Broken Heart

Wish I could be just a little less dramatic
Like a kennedy when Camelot went down in flames
Leave it to me to be holdin' the matches
When the fire trucks show up and there's nobody else to blame

Can't get revenge and keep a spotless reputation
Sometimes revenge is a choice you gotta make
My mama came from a softer generation
Where you get a grip and bite your lip just to save a little face

Go and fix your make-up, girl it's just a breakup
Run and hide you crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart, this ain't my Mama's Broken Heart

Powder your nose, Paint your toes
Line you lips and keep 'em closed
Cross your legs and dot your i's
And never let 'em see you cry

Go and fix your make-up, girl it's just a breakup
Run and hide your crazy and start actin' like a lady
'Cause I raised you better, gotta keep it together
Even when you fall apart, well this ain't my Mama's Broken Heart
