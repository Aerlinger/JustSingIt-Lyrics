I stared up at the sun
Thought of all the people, places and things I've loved
I stand up just to see
Of all the faces,
you are the one next to me

You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out the window, tonight...

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I lose myself tonight...
Yeah, Yeah , Yeah !

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I...
Lose myself tonight

*Instrumental*

I woke up with the sun
Thought of all the people, places and things I've loved
I woke up just to see
Of all the faces
you are the one next to me

You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out the window, tonight...

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I lose myself tonight...
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I...
Lose myself tonight
Whooooooo...Whooo ,Awhooo

*Instrumental*

Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...

Lose myself
If I lose myself tonight..
Whoooooooooo
whoooooo,whooooooo
