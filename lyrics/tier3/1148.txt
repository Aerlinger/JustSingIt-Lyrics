[Jay Sean]
Im all yours tonight
Got a feeling that I cant deny
Everything about gets me high
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
Im all yours
[Pitbull]
Success is here, and she dont play
Im ready for her, though, throw her my way
Heart torn, and I doubt you can save it
Its okay, its been like that since I was a baby
Thoughts deep, scuba
My mind is free, opposite of Cuba
Take me for my money and my fame?
Papa, dont try, see right through ya
Four lawsuits, one year
Two down, two to go
Fame expensive, yeah
Good thing I know
I was built for the war
I was built to be all yours
Abuelitas a rebel, my mothers a fighter
Tias a G and my sisters a rider
[Jay Sean]
Im all yours tonight
Got a feeling that I cant deny
Everything about gets me high
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
Im all yours
And celebrate tonight
And together we gon touch the sky
Everything about you gets me high
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
Im all yours
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
Im all yours
[Jay Sean]
Say it aint so
Youre reading every thought in my mind
Lady, lady, so damn beautiful
That I could just stare at you all night
The girls and the champagne, the music
Just dont feel to same, no
Cause lately these bright lights dont shine unless youre here with me, baby
[Jay Sean]
Im all yours tonight
Got a feeling that I cant deny
Everything about gets me high
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
[Beat Break]
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
Im all yours
[Pitbull]
But Id do it for you girl, Id ride for you girl
Id lie for you girl, Id cry for you
Die for you girl, the truth is its all for you girl
[Jay Sean]
We gon fly yeah
And we gon soar yeah
Tonight it is ours yeah
And Im all yours yeah
Yeah Im all yours yeah
yeah Im all yours yeah
yeah Im all yours yeah
yeah Im all yours
Im all yours tonight
Got a feeling that I cant deny
Everything about gets me high
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
Im all yours
Girl I want this for the rest of my life
Im all yours
