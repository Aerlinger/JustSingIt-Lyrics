The sun hits like a bullet of faith
And then suddenly I'm wide awake
Fake bliss, our apologies made
Was an enemy with no escape
My hands were tied
But now they're mine
So grab on to desire and run away
These will be the years
These will be the years
The lights will all appear
These will be the years

Yeeeeaaaars
These will be the years
Yeeeeaaaars

Grey dust now sparkle and gold and the best is yet to unfold
Why heat found in comfort and cold and a heart was found in her soul
Her hands are tied
But now they're mine
So grab on and where ever you'll go I'll go

These will be the years
These will be the years
The lights will all appear
These will be the years
Yeeeeaaaars
These will be the years

These will be the years
These will be the years
The lights will all appear
These will be the years
