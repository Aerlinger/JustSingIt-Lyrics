Im a, Im a, Im a, Im a flirt

Soon as I see her walk up in the club Im a flirt
Winkin eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs Im a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low Im a flirt
And when she's with her man lookin at me damn right Im a flirt

So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cause Im a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cause Im a flirt
Please believe it unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her 'round me because Im a flirt

Now I swear to tell the truth and the whole truth
When it comes to those I be pimpin like I supposed to
Rollin like I supposed to, shinin like I supposed to
In the club freakin with honeys like I supposed to

I don't understand when a player bring his girlfriend to the club
Freakin out on the flo' with his girlfriend in the club
And wonderin' why all these players tryin' to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom player Im gon holla at her

A dog on the prowl when I'm walkin through the mall
If I could man, I probably would flirt with all of y'all
Yeah yeah homey, you say she your girlfriend
But when I step up to her, Ima be like Tarzan

Believe me mayne, this is how them players do it in the Chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the Chi
Now the moral of story is cuff yo' chick
Cause hey, I'm black, handsome, I sing, plus I'm rich
And Im a flirt

Hey homie, if you ain't gettin no money
You better keep her away from me, ya dig?

Well if you love ya girl and wanna keep ya girl
Don't be walkin up and askin me to meet ya girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to ya girl
She winked her eyes on the sly, I seent ya girl

Better treat your girl right 'cause another man will
Better *** ya girl like another man will
'Cause you leave your wife and I see ya wife
That be for real, how long you think that's finna be ya wife?

When I'm livin the life, you just gettin' it right
Your old lady look at me cause you ain't hittin' it right
She probably used to like you 'cause you the business type
That's until I came along and put some **** in her life

Wanna say, had an ***, **** a **** in the lights
And I noticed she was checkin me and diggin the ice
And if I get that tonight, better hit that twice
I could even make her mine if I hit that right

You know smack that thang, sit that right
Up on that dress, say yeah that's right
Pullin on her hair like we gettin in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight but it'll spread just right

So if yo girl sexy and she pass me
Don't be upset G cause you might catch me
Tryin to catch a glance up her skirt
Then we playin in reverse
If I see her and I like her then I'ma flirt

When I, when I, when I
When I pull up to club all the shawties be like, Damn! 28's!
Then I be like, "Girl you know just who I am, don't hate"
Say I done fell in love wit a stripper yall
All I do is flirt with her and I get them drawers

And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy Pain was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'ma flirt whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me Teddy Bend-Her-A**-Down

I be like, Como te llama lil momma?
Me llamo Pain, what is yo name?
I'm feelin yo vibe and I'm hopin you feel the same
I'ma wink my eye and let you know I got the game
When I pass by I know exactly what you say

He's so fly and yes he's so cool
Hey shawty, hey shawty, what it do
He mad 'cause I'm lookin' but I already touched her
I got your boyfriend mad cause Im a flirt

Soon as I see her walk up in the club Im a flirt
Winkin eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs Im a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low Im a flirt
And when she's with her man lookin at me damn right Im a flirt

So homies don't bring your girl to meet me cause Im a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cause Im a flirt
Please believe it unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her 'round me because Im a flirt

It's the remix!

Now if you walk up in the club wit a bad chick
And she lookin' at me then I'm gon' hit
Man jackin' for chicks, I tried to quit it
But I'm a playa homie so I had to hit it

While you buyin' her drinks in the club
Actin' like you in love
Stuntin' like you all thug
We was switchin' numbers

She lookin' at you when I walk by
You turn yo' head, she wink her eye
I can't help it if she checkin' for a platinum type of guy
She be callin' me daddy and I be callin' her mommy
She be callin' you Kelly when yo' name is Tommy

I don't know what y'all be thinkin' when you bring 'em round me
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B
Do you know what that means? That means if you love yo' chick
Don't bring her to the VIP 'cause I might leave wit yo' chick

Just keepin' it real ** *****, it's a playa's field ** *****
Don't take no trick to the club when you just met her ** *****
'Cause I'm flirt wit her right, and he gon' flirt wit her right
And if she lickin' dat good ****, she gon' flirt wit her
I'm a flirt

Soon as I see her walk up in the club Im a flirt
Winkin eyes at me when I roll up on them dubs Im a flirt
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low Im a flirt
And when she's with her man lookin at me damn right Im a flirt

So homie don't bring your girl to meet me cause Im a flirt
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat cause Im a flirt
Please believe it unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her 'round me because Im a flirt

Kels, T.I., T-Pain
Ladies, if your man ain't hitting it right
Just call this number on the screen
I'll be at your rescue, yeah
