	<li><p>Hey girl, what's your name girl?</p></li>
	<li><p>I've been looking at you</p></li>
	<li><p>And every guy here's doing the same, girl</p></li>
	<li><p>It'd be a shame, girl, if I let you just walk on by</p></li>
	<li><p>'Cause I'm all caught up in your sweet smile</p></li>
	<li><p>A girl like you comes around once in a while</p></li>
	<li><p>So hot, gotta give it a shot</p></li>
	<li><p>Gotta get a little bit of what you got</p></li>
	<li><p>I know you don't know me</p></li>
	<li><p>But I can't leave here lonely</p></li>
	<li><p>Knowing I didn't even try to make you mine</p></li>
	<li><p>And you might think I'm crazy</p></li>
	<li><p>Girl, but who could blame me?</p></li>
	<li><p>You're looking so fine, got me all tongue tied</p></li>
	<li><p>And the only line I can think to say is</p></li>
	<li><p>Hey girl, what you think, girl?</p></li>
	<li><p>You look a little thirsty</p></li>
	<li><p>Let me go and get you something to drink, girl</p></li>
	<li><p>Before you blink, girl</p></li>
	<li><p>I'll be right back by your side</p></li>
	<li><p>And if you want we can roll out</p></li>
	<li><p>I know my way around this town</p></li>
	<li><p>I got a shotgun seat for you</p></li>
	<li><p>You can tell me where it is you wanna take off to</p></li>
	<li><p>I know you don't know me</p></li>
	<li><p>But I can't leave here lonely</p></li>
	<li><p>Knowing I didn't even try to make you mine</p></li>
	<li><p>And you might think I'm crazy</p></li>

	<li><p>Baby, you're still standing here</p></li>
	<li><p>I guess you must like what you hear</p></li>
	<li><p>Hey, girl, what you say, girl?</p></li>
	<li><p>About you and me getting away, girl</p></li>
	<li><p>I know you don't know me</p></li>
