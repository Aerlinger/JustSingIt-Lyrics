You hold your truth so purely
Well swerve not through the minds of men
This lie is dead

This cup of yours tastes holy
But a brush with the devil can clear your mind and strengthen your spine

But fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance

Whispers in the dark
Steal a kiss and you'll break your heart
Pick up your clothes and curl your toes
Learn your lesson, lead me home
Spare my sins for the ark, I was too slow to depart
I'm a coward but I'm not a fraud, I'd set out to serve the Lord

But my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head but found the one that I love
Under the sun, under the sun

But fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance
Fingers tap into what you were once
And I'm worried that I blew my only chance!

(Woo!)

*Instrumental break*

But my heart was colder when you'd gone
And I lost my head; let's live while we are young
While we are young
While we are young
While we are young
