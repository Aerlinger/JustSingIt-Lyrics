[Intro]

(Turn the lights on!)
Sockin' wet
She can't keep dry
I need it bad
Me not tell no lie

Put both your hands
Upon the wall
Fleed up girl
I won't let you fall

Gotta friend 'round see
There as you there
Put it down repeat
Why you do that girl

Gotta little lower
Push on wine
She gon' feel my power
She gon' blow my mind

[Bridge]

Soon I'll spend all night tight up with her
Uptight, up with her
Uptight, up with her

[Chorus]

Cause me love it when you push it up on me
So me love it when you twist up her body on me
She know I can't resist when she on me
