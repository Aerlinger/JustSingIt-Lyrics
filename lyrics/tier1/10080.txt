Hey, hey, good lookin'
Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin'
Somethin' up with me?

Hey, sweet baby,
Don't you think maybe
We could find us
A brand new recipe?

I got a Hot-Rod Ford
And a two-dollar bill
And I know a spot
Right over the hill

There's soda pop
And the dancin's free
So if you wanna have fun
Come along with me

Say, hey, good lookin'
Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin'
Somethin' up with me?

I'm free and ready
So we can go steady
How's about savin'
All your time for me?

No more lookin'
I know I've been tooken
How's about keepin'
Steady company?

I'm gonna throw
My date-book over the fence
And find me one
For five or ten cents

I'll keep it
'Til it's covered with age
'Cause I'm writin' your name
Down on every page

Say hey, good lookin'
Whatcha got cookin'?
How's about cookin'
Somethin' up with me?
