[:chorus:]
Only time...
(interlude)
Dee dah day, dee dah day, dee dah day
Dee dah doe day doe, dee doe day doe

Who can say why your heart sighs,
As your love flies?
Only time...
And who can say why your heart cries,
When your love lies?

[:chorus:]
Only time...
(interlude)
Dee dah day, dee dah day, dee dah day
Dee dah doe day doe, dee doe day doe
