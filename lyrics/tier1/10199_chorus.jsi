[:chorus:]
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry
Don't make a grown man cry

My eyes dilate, my lips go green
My hands are greasy, she's a mean, mean machine
Start it up
Start me up
Give it all you got
You got to never, never, never stop
Slide it up, baby just slide it up
Slide it up, slide it up, never, never, never

[:chorus:]
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
You make a grown man cry
