It dont matter what plans Ive got, I can break em
Yeah, I can turn this thing around at the next red light
And I dont mind tellin all the guys I cant meet em
Hell, we can all go raise some hell on any other night
Girl, I dont care, oh, I just gotta see what youre wearin
Your hair, is it pulled up or fallin down
Oh, I just have to see it now

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You dont have to worry bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby thats alright
This is a drop everything kinda thing
Swing on by, Ill pour you a drink
The doors unlocked, Ill leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

Aint a spot downtown thats rockin the way that you rock me
Aint a bar that can make me buzz the way that you do
I could be on the front row of the best show
And look down and see your face on my phone
And Im gone, so long, hang on
Ill meet you in a minute or two

[Chorus]
If you wanna call me, call me, call me
You dont have to worry bout it, baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby thats alright
This is a drop everything kinda thing
Swing on by, Ill pour you a drink
The doors unlocked, Ill leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime

If its two in the mornin and youre feelin lonely
And wonderin what Im doin

Go ahead and call me, call me, call me
Cause you dont have to worry bout it baby
You can wake me up in the dead of the night
Wreck my plans, baby thats alright
This is a drop everything kinda thing
Swing on by, Ill pour you a drink
The doors unlocked, Ill leave on the lights
Baby, you can crash my party anytime
