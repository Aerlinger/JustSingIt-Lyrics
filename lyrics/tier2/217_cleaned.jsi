I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track
It turns into gold
Everybody knows

I've got the magic in me
When I hit the flow the girls come
Snappin' at me
Now everybody wants some presto

Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me

These tricks that I'll attempt
Will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse
I'll hypnotize you with every line

I'll need a volunteer
How about you, with the eyes?
Come on down to the front
And stand right here and don't be shy

I'll have you time-travellin'
Have your mind babblin'
People tryin' to inherit the skill
So they asking me

Even David Blaine had to go
And take some classes
And I see Mindfreak like
What's up man, what's happenin'?

So come one, come all
And see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded
No Ghost or Poltergeist

You know I'm no Pinocchio
I've never told a lie
So call me Mr. Magic Man
I float on Cloud Nine

I got the magic in me
(I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it
Turns into gold
(Yes it turns to gold)
Everybody knows

I've got the magic in me
(I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the flow the girls come
Snappin' at me
(They be snappin' baby)
Now everybody wants some presto

Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me

Well, take a journey into my mind
You'll see why it's venom I rhyme
Stay on the road
So I call my mama when I got time

I hit the stage, go insane
Then jump into that crowd
See, see, when I rhyme
I flow on the beat like pidda-dow-dow

See I deceive you with my
Intergalactic ether
I sing just like Aretha
So respect me like I'm Caesar

I kick it like Adidas
Flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on
Will leave you with amnesia

I break all the rules
Like Evel Knievel
It's a spectacular show
'Cause my heart pumps diesel

So whatever you saying
It don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday
Hocus pocus is my styl-o

I got the magic in me
(I got the magic, baby)
Every time I touch that track it
Turns into gold
(Yes it turns to gold)
Everybody knows

I've got the magic in me
(I got the magic, baby)
When I hit the flow the girls come
Snappin' at me
(They be snappin' baby)
Now everybody wants some presto

Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
I got the magic in me
