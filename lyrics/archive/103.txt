	<li><p>I looked in my rearview mirror and</p></li>
	<li><p>It seemed to make a lot more sense</p></li>
	<li><p>Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm ready to make that turn</p></li>
	<li><p>Before we both crash and burn</p></li>
	<li><p>'Cause that could be the death of us</p></li>
	<li><p>The death of us, baby</p></li>
	<li><p>You know how to drive in rain</p></li>
	<li><p>And you decided not to make a change</p></li>
	<li><p>Stuck in the same old lane</p></li>
	<li><p>Going the wrong way home</p></li>
	<li><p>I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want</p></li>
	<li><p>Let's just go back to the way it was</p></li>
	<li><p>When we were on Honeymoon Avenue, Honeymoon Avenue</p></li>
	<li><p>Baby, coasting like crazy</p></li>
	<li><p>Can we get back to the way it was?</p></li>
	<li><p>Hey, what happened to the butterflies?</p></li>
	<li><p>Guess they encountered that stop sign</p></li>
	<li><p>And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light</p></li>
	<li><p>Hey, right when I think that we found it</p></li>
	<li><p>Well, that's when we start turnin' around</p></li>
	<li><p>You're saying baby don't worry</p></li>
	<li><p>But we're still going the wrong way</p></li>
	<li><p>Baby, you know how to drive in rain</p></li>
	<li><p>And you decided not to make a change</p></li>
	<li><p>Stuck in the same old lane</p></li>
	<li><p>Going the wrong way home</p></li>

	<li><p>Can we get back to the way it was?</p></li>
	<li><p>They say only fools fall in love</p></li>
	<li><p>They must have been talking about us</p></li>
	<li><p>And sometimes I feel like we've been here before</p></li>
	<li><p>I could be wrong, but I know I'm right</p></li>
	<li><p>We gon' be lost if we continue to fight</p></li>
	<li><p>Honey, I know</p></li>
	<li><p>We can find our way home</p></li>
	<li><p>I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper to bumper traffic</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want</p></li>
