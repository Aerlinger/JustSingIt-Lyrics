Ooo
Oooh
Ooo Oh Oh
Lately I've been thinking, thinking about what we had
And I know it was hard, it was all that we knew, yeah
Have you been drinking, to take all the pain away?
I wish that I could give you what you deserve
Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do, yeah
You know there's no one, I can relate to
I know we won't find a love that's so true

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together, oh

I gave you everything babe
Well, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away? yeah
Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day
But that is the past now, we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be yeah
Tell me, was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see

There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together through the storm
There's nothing like us
There's nothing like you and me together
