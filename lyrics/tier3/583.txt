Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Turn around, stick it out, show the world what you got a
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Turn around, stick it out, show the world you got it!

Whine, go down, turn and flick it
Girl like me, know a fucking I'm gonna do wicked
One bott, two bottles, swing it like cricket
My lock stock, my eyes, I'm a show ya, I'm a wicked!
Baby, baby, let me tell ya about the body, yeah
Make you feel that beat like a Nokia
Out my way now look after the body, yeah
Even cartel are up here.

Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Turn around, stick it out, show the world what you got a
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Turn around, stick it out, show the world you got it!

So I had a cute thing, buenas noches
By the end of the night my knees are now on your chest
Fuck me bad, let me in, a cardio caress
Make me come!
Make me come!
Come, we know you are the best!
Who's bad?
Let me wind upon your cock
Tick-tock-tick, riding the clock
Beat it, beat it, beat it bad, let me show you what I've got!
I ain't Snoop Dogg, but I'mma drop it like it's hot!

Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Turn around, stick it out, show the world what you got a
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Turn around, stick it out, show the world you got it!

OK, open up your bubble butt, let me see your bumper
The booty so smooth, can believe is not butter
I go in from under, she wetter than a surfer
I ate the pussy fast, I'm about to start burpin'.
I burp, burp and re-lick the bottom of the surface
I load in my clip in and told her, "don't get nervous!"
I'm a Bang Bang Chiddy, bang, bang bang killer
Nipple tit clit licker
Ball like a dribble
Put you on a pickle, nibble on my dickle
Why you're tripping? I'm a crazy individual
Never do minimum, drive Benz, Bentley too!
Damn, bitch, talk much, I don't want interviews
Ha, I'm trying to get into you, into you
They're making you my enemy, hot!
Not playing got the bitch mad
Me don't like flat screen, as I need a 3D!

Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Turn around, stick it out, show the world what you got a
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Bubble butt, bubble, bubble, bubble butt
Turn around, stick it out, show the world you got it!
