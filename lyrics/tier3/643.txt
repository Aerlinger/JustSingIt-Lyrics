Ready to go
Ready to go

You're weird in tears, too near and too far away
He said, "Saw red," went home stayed in bed all day
Your T-shirt's dish dirt always love the one you hurt

It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops
Shouting out baby I'm ready to go
I'm back I'm ready to go

From the rooftops shout it out
It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah I'm standing on the rooftops
Having it baby I'm ready to go

I'm back, I'm ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
Shout it out

You sleep too deep, one week is another world
Big mouth, big mouth, drop out, drop out
You get what you deserve
You're strange, insane, one thing you can never change

It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops
Shouting out baby I'm ready to go
I'm back I'm ready to go

From the rooftops shout it out
It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops
Having it baby I'm ready to go

I'm back, I'm ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
Shout it out

Ready to go

Abused, confused, always love the one
You hurt, you hurt, you hurt, you hurt, you

It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops
Shouting out baby I'm ready to go
I'm back I'm ready to go

From the rooftops shout it out
It's a crack, I'm back
Yeah, I'm standing on the rooftops
Having it baby I'm ready to go

I'm back, I'm ready to go
From the rooftops shout it out
Its a crack

Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
Baby, I'm ready to go
