(Ooh, ooh, sweet love, yeah)

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should've held on tight, I never should've let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself

I could not fathom I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you, 'cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I've never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here, 'cause baby
(We belong together)

When you left I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
(Come back, come back)
Come back baby, please
(Come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough (Ooooooh yeah)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up (Oooooh yeah)
Who's gonna take your place, there ain't nobody better (Oooooooh yeah)
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio singing to me:
"If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute this is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station so I turn the dial
Trying to catch a break and then I hear Babyface
I only think of you and it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
I'm throwing things, crying
Trying to figure out where the @#$% I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby
(We belong together)

When you left I lost a part of me (Together)
It's still so hard to believe
(Come back, come back)
Come back baby, please
(Come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough (Ooooooh yeah)
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up (Oooooh yeah)
Who's gonna take your place, there ain't nobody better (Oooooooh yeah)
Oh, baby baby, we belong together baby! (We belong together)

When you left I lost a part of me (Together)
(Oooooooh yeah)
It's still so hard to believe
(Come back, come back)
Come back baby, please (Oooooooh yeah)
(Come back, come back)
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough (Ooooooh yeah)
Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up (Ooooooh yeah)
Who's gonna take your place, there ain't nobody better (Oooooooh yeah)
Oh, baby baby, we belong together!

Ooooooh yeah
Ooooooh yeah
Ooooooh yeah
We belong together
