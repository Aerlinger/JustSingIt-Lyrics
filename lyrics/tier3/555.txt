There is a bottle on the shelf talking to me
Saying come over here you can have a drink
We can make it through this lonely night together
Thats a road I dont want to go back down
And I hate myself for what Im thinking now
Hey its just one night its not like its forever
I just want to feel better

I just want to feel good
Feel alright
Feel anything but what I feel tonight
I just want to move on with my life
And put the pieces back together
I just want to feel better

All these pictures running through my head
From the way he loved to the way he left
Not a single day goes by I dont miss him
When the lonely gets to be too much
I try to kill the pain with a strangers touch
Although I know I wont forget him all together
I just want to feel better

I just want to feel good
Feel alright
Feel anything than what I feel tonight
I just want to move on with my life
And put the pieces back together
I just want to feel better

Oh I know there is going to come a day
Where hes still gone and its okay

I just want to feel good
Feel alright
Feel anything than what I feel tonight
I just want to move on with my life
And put the pieces back together
Oh I just want to feel better
I just want to feel better
