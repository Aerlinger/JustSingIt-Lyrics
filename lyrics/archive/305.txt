	<li><p>Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain</p></li>
	<li><p>Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain</p></li>
	<li><p>Time starts to pass, before you know it, you're frozen</p></li>
	<li><p>But something happened</p></li>
	<li><p>For the very first time with you</p></li>
	<li><p>My heart melts into the ground, found something true</p></li>
	<li><p>And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy</p></li>
	<li><p>But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you</p></li>
	<li><p>They try to pull me away but they don't know the truth</p></li>
	<li><p>My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing</p></li>
	<li><p>You cut me open and I</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep bleeding</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep, keep bleeding love</p></li>
	<li><p>I keep bleeding</p></li>
	<li><p>I keep, keep bleeding love</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep bleeding</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep, keep bleeding love</p></li>
	<li><p>You cut me open</p></li>
	<li><p>Trying hard not to hear but they talk so loud</p></li>
	<li><p>Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt</p></li>
	<li><p>Yet I know that the goal is to keep me from falling</p></li>
	<li><p>But nothing's greater than the rush that comes with your embrace</p></li>
	<li><p>And in this world of loneliness, I see your face</p></li>
	<li><p>Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy, maybe, maybe</p></li>
	<li><p>But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you</p></li>
	<li><p>They try to pull me away but they don't know the truth</p></li>
	<li><p>My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing</p></li>
	<li><p>You cut me open and I</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep bleeding</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep, keep bleeding love</p></li>
	<li><p>I keep bleeding</p></li>
	<li><p>I keep, keep bleeding love</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep bleeding</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep, keep bleeding love</p></li>
	<li><p>You cut me open</p></li>
	<li><p>And it's draining all of me</p></li>
	<li><p>Oh, they find it hard to believe</p></li>
	<li><p>I'll be wearing these scars for everyone to see</p></li>
	<li><p>I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you</p></li>
	<li><p>They try to pull me away but they don't know the truth</p></li>
	<li><p>My heart's crippled by the vein that I keep on closing</p></li>
	<li><p>You cut me open and I</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep bleeding</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep, keep bleeding love</p></li>
	<li><p>I keep bleeding</p></li>
	<li><p>I keep, keep bleeding love</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep bleeding</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep, keep bleeding love</p></li>
	<li><p>You cut me open and I</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep bleeding</p></li>
	<li><p>Keep, keep bleeding love</p></li>
