Every where i look, i just see you, on your own
All that it took, was one call, from his phone
Forgive me if im wrong, but you look shit, all alone
So give me a shot, cause i could be, the dog to your bone
or something

Even after all, all the bad things, that you show
We should be together, share in this love, in my home
I know im not wrong, you still look shit all alone
So give me a shot, cause i could be

Everywhere i look, i just see you, on your own
All that it took, was one call, from his phone
