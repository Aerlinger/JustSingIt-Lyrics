Oh, caught in a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance

Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah
Roma, roma, ma
Gaga, ooh, la, la la
Want your bad romance

Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah
Roma, roma, ma
Gaga, ooh la la la
Want your bad romance

I want your ugly, I want your disease
I want your everything as long as it's free
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love

I want your drama, the touch of your hand
I want your leather studded kiss in the sand
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
(Love, love, love, I want your love)

You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
I want it bad, your bad romance

I want your love, and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love, and all your love is revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

Oh, caught in a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance

Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah
Roma, roma, ma
Gaga, ooh la la la
Want your bad romance

I want your horror, I want your design
'Cause you're a criminal as long as you're mine
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love

I want your psycho, your vertigo shtick
Want you in my rear window, baby, you're sick
I want your love
Love, love, love, I want your love
(Love, love, love, I want your love)

You know that I want you
And you know that I need you
('Cause I'm a free bitch, baby)
I want it bad, your bad romance

I want your love, and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love, and all your love is revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

Oh, caught in a bad romance
Oh, caught in a bad romance

Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah
Roma, roma, ma
Gaga, ooh la la la
Want your bad romance

Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah
Roma, roma, ma
Gaga, ooh la la la
Want your bad romance

Walk, walk, fashion, baby
Work it, move that bitch, crazy
Walk, walk, fashion, baby
Work it, move that bitch, crazy

Walk, walk, fashion, baby
Work it, move that bitch, crazy
Walk, walk, passion, baby
Work it, I'm a free bitch, baby

I want your love, and I want your revenge
I want your love, I don't wanna be friends
J'veux ton amour et je veux ta revanche
J'veux ton amour, I don't wanna be friends

No, I don't wanna be friends
(Oh, caught in a bad romance)
I don't wanna be friends

Want your bad romance
(Oh, caught in a bad romance)
Want your bad romance

I want your love, and I want your revenge
You and me could write a bad romance
I want your love, and all your lover's revenge
You and me could write a bad romance

Want your bad romance
(Oh, caught in a bad romance)
Want your bad romance
Want your bad romance
(Oh, caught in a bad romance)

Rah, rah, ah, ah, ah
Roma, roma, ma
Gaga, ooh la la la
Want your bad romance
