You wanna play, you wanna stay, you wanna have it all
You started messing with my head until I hit a wall
Maybe I should've known, maybe I should've known
That you would walk, you would walk out the door, hey!

Said we were done, and met someone and rubbed it in my face
Cut to the part she broke your heart, and then she ran away
I guess you shoulda known, I guess you shoulda known
That I would talk, I would talk

But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh oh oh I really dont care
But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh oh oh I really dont care
Oh oh oh I really dont care

I can't believe I ever stayed up writing songs about you
You don't deserve to know the way I used to think about you
Oh no, not anymore, oh no, not anymore
You had your shot, had your shot, but you let go

Now if we meet out on the street I wont be running scared
Ill walk right up to you and put one finger in the air
And make you understand, and make you understand
You had your chance, had your chance

But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh oh oh I really dont care
But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh oh oh I really dont care
Oh oh oh I really dont care

[Cher Lloyd]
Yeah, listen up
Hey, hey never look back
Dumbstruck boy, ego intact
Look boy, why you so mad
Second guess him, but shoulda hit that
Hey Demi you picked the wrong lover
Shoulda picked that one, hes cuter than the other
I just wanna laugh, cause you tryna be a hipster
Kick him to the club, take a Polaroid picture

But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh oh oh I really dont care
But even if the stars and moon collide
I never want you back into my life
You can take your words and all your lies
Oh oh oh I really dont care
Oh oh oh I really dont care
