I've been looking for a driver who is qualified
So if you think that you're the one step into my ride
I'm a fine-tuned supersonic speed machine
Got a sunroof top and a gangster lead

So if you feel it, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night

'Cause it's 0 to 60 in 3.5
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive, drive, drive
Shut up and drive, drive, drive

I got class like a '57 Cadillac
And overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle what's under my hood
You keep saying that you will, boy, I wish you would

So if you feel it, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night

'Cause it's 0 to 60 in 3.5
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive, drive, drive
Shut up and drive, drive, drive

[Incomprehensible] what I got
Get it, get it, don't stop, it's a sure shot
Ain't a Ferrari, huh, boy, I'm sorry
I ain't even worried, so step inside
And ride, ride, ride

So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waiting for, for, for?
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go

Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night

'Cause it's 0 to 60 in 3.5
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive, drive, drive
Shut up and drive, drive, drive
Shut up and drive, drive, drive
Shut up and drive, drive, drive
