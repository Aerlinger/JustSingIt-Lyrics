There's been times, I'm so confused
And all my road, they lead to you
Just can't turn and walk away

It's hard to say what it is I see in you
If I'll always be with you
Words can't say it, I can't do
Enough to prove, it's all for you

Finally I figured out
But it took a long, long time
Now there's a turnabout
Maybe 'cause I'm tryin', yeah

There's been times, I'm so confused
All my road, they lead to you
Just can't turn and walk away

Well, it's hard to say what it is I see in you
If I'll always be with you
Words can't say it, I can't do
Enough to prove, it's all for you

I'd thought I seen it all
'Cause it's been a long, long time
Oh but then we'll trip and fall
Wonderin' if I'm blind, yeah

There's been times, I'm so confused
All my roads, they lead to you
I just can't turn, you walk away

It's hard to say what it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always be with you
Words can't say and I can't do
Enough to prove it's all for you

Rain comes pourin' down
Fallin' from blue skies
Words give out a sound
Comin' from your eyes

Finally I figured out
But it took a long, long time
Oh now there's a turnabout
Maybe 'cause I'm tryin'

There's been times, I'm so confused
All my roads, they lead to you
Just can't turn and you walk away

It's hard to say what it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always be with you
Words can't say, I can't do
Enough to prove it's all for you

It's hard to say what it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always be with you
Words can't say, I can't do
Enough to prove, it's all for you

Well it's hard to say what it is I see in you
Wonder if I'll always be with you
Words can't say, I can't do
Enough to prove, it's all for you
Hard to say, yeah, yeah
Hard to say, it's all for you
