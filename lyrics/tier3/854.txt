[VERSE 1]
Close your tired eyes relax and then
Count from one to ten and open them
All these heavy thoughts will try to weigh you down
But not this time

Way up in the air you're finally free
And you can stay up there right next to me
All this gravity will try to pull you down
But not this time

[CHORUS]
When the sun goes down and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are

Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause its time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are... tonight

Woah, Woah, Woah

Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are... tonight

[VERSE 2]
Gaze into my eyes when the fire starts
And fan the flame so hot it melts our hearts
Oh, the pouring rain will try to put it out
But not this time

Let your colors burn and brightly burst
Into a million sparks that all disperse
And illuminate a world that will try to bring you down
But not this time

[CHORUS]
When the sun goes down and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are

Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause its time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are... tonight

Woah, Woah, Woah

Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are... tonight

[BRIDGE]
A thousand heartbeats beat in time
And makes this dark planet come alive
So when the lights flicker out tonight
You gotta shine

[CHORUS]
When the sun goes down and the lights burn out
Then it's time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are

Fill the darkest night with a brilliant light
'Cause its time for you to shine
Brighter than a shooting star
So shine no matter where you are... tonight

Woah, Woah, Woah

Brighter than a shooting star
Shine no matter where you are... tonight
