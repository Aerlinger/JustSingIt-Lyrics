Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round
Like a ferris wheel,that's breakin' down
Drinkin' angel's piss, gonna crash and burn
I just want some action so give me my turn
Like a Chinese drama and conspiracy
it's the death of the nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in high-fidelity for me too
Can you hear the sound coming over the hill?
Gotta move my feet, it's coming in for the kill
B-baby, baby, it's a blow out! Oh yeah!
Like a nuclear bomb and it wont be long 'til I detonate!

Like a Chinese drama and conspiracy
it's the death of the nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in high-fidelity for me too

Gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round
Like a ferris wheel, that's breakin' down
Scream, scream, screaming bloody murder! Oh yeah
Like a nuclear bomb and it wont be long 'til I detonate
Like a Chinese drama and conspiracy
it's the death of the nuclear family staring up at you
It's looking like another bad comedy
Just as long as it comes in high-fidelity for me too

I said 10...9..8...7...6...5...4...3 ,5,4,3,2,1
