[Intro:]
Ey, ha ha, make a wish girl
You deserve it
Uh-huh, ha, ha, yeah
[Verse 1: Cher Lloyd]
Baby, I seen the chick you're with, wish that I never did
Freakin' perfect and five foot ten, just wanna punch her lip
'Cause I know I've been wasting time tryinna catch your eye
Yeah I know that I been so blind thinking that I'm your type
And now I'm at home, I'm all alone
'Bout to pick up the telephone
Got to call my genie so he knows, yeah
[Chorus:]
I wish I was tall, I wish I was fast
Wish I could shop with a bag full of cash
'Cause If I want you, I gotta have that
(Come, come kiss me boy)
I wish I had style, I wish I had flash
Wish I woke up with a butt and a rack
'Cause If I want you, I gotta have that
(Come, come kiss me boy)
(Uh-huh, yeah)
[Verse 2: Cher Lloyd]
Baby, I'm gonna keep it real, boy you da one I want
I don't own any five inch heels, just got my Nike's on
Never thought I was insecure, boy look at what you done (what you done)
I don't know what I studied for, clearly you like 'em dumb
And now I'm at home I'm all alone,
'Bout to pick up the telephone
Got to call my genie so he knows, yeah
[Chorus:]
I wish I was tall, I wish I was fast
Wish I could shop with a bag full of cash
'Cause If I want you, I gotta have that
(Come, come kiss me boy)
I wish I had style, I wish I had flash
Wish I woke up with a butt and a rack
'Cause If I want you, I gotta have that
(Come, come kiss me boy)
[Verse 3: T.I.]
Hey, now don't you wanna do some, baby,
With the roof gone, baby
Aston Martin look retarded like the coup gone crazy
I'm not sure what kinda fella you like
But I can give you paradise, have it however you like
I'm talking solitaire iced out, ring, watch, necklace
Ain't no talking reckless, girl, I'm certified respected, girl
Yeah, you like to run your mouth, well you about to learn a lesson, girl
Yeah, you the one but I'll replace you in a second, girl
And I ain't even trying to see you naked, girl
Wait, there I go exaggerate
Clearly carried away
But what I'm saying you could true that
I wanna be wherever you at
So you wishing you could kiss me
Do you really wanna do that, eh?
Make a wish, girl
(Yeah)
[Chorus:]
I wish I was tall, I wish I was fast
Wish I could shop with a bag full of cash
'Cause If I want you, I gotta have that
(Come, come kiss me boy)
I wish I had style, I wish I had flash
Wish I woke up with a butt and a rack
'Cause If I want you, I gotta have that
(Come, come kiss me boy)
I wish I was tall
'Cause If I want you, I gotta have that
(Come, come kiss me boy)
I wish I had, I wish I had, I wish I had yeah yeah
'Cause If I want you, I gotta have that
(Come, come kiss me boy)
