Oh, oh, never find a love like this
Oh, oh, never find a love like this

Well we go back so far swingin' in your backyard
All the things that we used to do
We were cool back in high school, ooh, I really liked you
Must have been your attitude

And that's why you keep on runnin' in and out of my mind
As the years they all roll by, baby, now I know why
I keep comin' back to you

You're the only one that knows me, love it when you hold me
I'd never find a love like this, let me hear you say
Now I'll never be lonely, look at what you've shown me
I'd never find a love like this

When this life tries to keep us apart
You keep callin' me back to your heart, let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me, wrap you all around me
I'd never find a love like this

All the guys tried to take me, you're the one who saved me
I feel like I owe you my life
And as strange as it may seem, I'll go if you take me
I'm willing to sacrifice

And that's why you keep on runnin' in and out of my mind
As the years they all roll by, it's not hard to know why
I keep comin' back to you

You're the only one that knows me, love it when you hold me
I'd never find a love like this, let me hear you say
Now I'll never be lonely, look at what you've shown me
I'd never find a love like this

When this life tries to keep us apart
You keep callin' me back to your heart, let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me, wrap you all around me
I'd never find a love like this

May never find a l-l-love like this
That still make me think about my middle school kiss
I sit here in this chair and I wish for you not to leave me now

My friends they always told me, not to make you my wifey
Man they was puttin' you down
And now they see we rollin', me and you, we strollin'
They don't wanna come around

Let me hear you say
You're the only one that knows me, love it when you hold me
I'd never find a love like this, let me hear you say
Now I'll never be lonely, look at what you've shown me
I'd never find a love like this

When this life tries to keep us apart
You keep callin' me back to your heart, let me hear you say
I'm so glad you found me, wrap you all around me
I'd never find a love like this

Oh, oh, never find a love like this
Oh, oh, never find a love like this
Oh, oh, never find a love like this
Oh, oh, never find a love like this
Oh, oh, never find a love like this

When this life tries to keep us apart
You keep callin' me back to your heart, let me hear you say
Oh, oh, never find a love like this
Oh, oh, never find a love like this
