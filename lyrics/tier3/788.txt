Hey, Love
Thought that I should share my day
It felt a little bit crazy, baby
I cleared the closet so I'm out your way
Guess you can have your space

Well I thought that I should write a letter
then I thought this would be better, don't yell
There's a million ways that I could tell you
but I think I'd rather show you it's over
and I won't be back no more

[Hook]
D-D-Don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you got til it's gone
D-D-Don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you got til it's gone
Gave you my heart
it slipped through your fingers
now you don't want to play
D-D-Don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you got til it's gone

Oh, Love
Your dinner's waiting down the street
And you can have it your way
So, Love
The mess you made is your to clean
So don't be looking at me

See I don't mean to disrespect you
but I think that you could have done me better, don't you
There's a million ways that I could tell you
but I think I'd rather show you it's over
and I won't be back no more

[Hook]
D-D-Don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you got til it's gone
D-D-Don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you got til it's gone
Gave you my heart
it slipped through your fingers
now you don't want to play
D-D-Don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you got til it's gone

[Wiz Khalifa]
Where you going
What you doing
Oh you must be at the point where you can't take this no more
So you grabbing your stuff, walking out the door
Moving so fast, forgot what we was even arguing for
Man, I know you like that back of my hand
You like to break up, then make up
Roll me up a joint soon as I wake up
When I put it down mess up your makeup
Everything provided when you rolling with a rider, huh
You been in Hollywood so long your ass starting to act Hollywood
Talk about you gon' leave, probably should
I ain't tripping
Just a bunch of extra shit that
I ain't missing
My sister tried to tell me 'bout you
I ain't listen
Now we going down this road
Hit the smoke, said bro, I've been here before
And you know Kelly never lie
So you can get your stuff and get to going, I'll get back to getting high

There's a million ways that I could tell you
But I think I'd rather show you it's over
And I won't be back no more

[Hook]
D-D-Don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you got til it's gone
D-D-Don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you got til it's gone
Gave you my heart
it slipped through your fingers
now you don't want to play
D-D-Don't it always seem to go
that you don't know what you got til it's gone
