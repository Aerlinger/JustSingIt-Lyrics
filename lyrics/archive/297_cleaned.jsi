This old man and me
Were at the bar and we
Were havin' us some beers and
Swappin' I don't cares
Talkin' politics
Blonde and redhead chicks
Old dogs and new tricks and
Habits we ain't kicked
We talked about Gods grace
And all the @#$% we raised
Then I heard the old man say,
“God is great, beer is good and People Are Crazy”
He said "I fought two wars,
Been married and divorced"
What brings you to Ohio?
He said "@#$% if I know"
We talked an hour or two
About every girl we knew
What all we put ‘em through
Like two old boys will do
We pondered life and death
He light a cigarette
He said "These @#$% things will kill me yet,
But God is great, beer is good and people are crazy"
Last call its 2:00am
I said goodbye to him
I never talked to him again
Then one sunny day
I saw the old man's face
Front page Obituary
He was a millionaire he
He left his fortune to
Some guy he barely knew
His kids were mad as @#$%
Huh but me, I'm doing well
And I drop by today
To just say thanks and pray
And I left a six-pack right there on his grave
And I said God is great, beer is good and people are crazy
God is great, beer is good and people are crazy
God is great, beer is good and people are crazy
