If you live for something, youre not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter, and toast to life

Luda!

They say what dont kill me, can make me stronger
So two drinks a night should help me live longer
I blow some smoke just to give my lungs a test
Cause why tip toe through life, to arrive safely at death
Im on a journey, yeah, Im on a roll
Sometimes gotta close my eyes, just to open my soul
And tonight is the night, I gotta feeling that Im about act a fool
So if you go fix some drinks me and Usher are about to break some rules

Got somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke a lesson I can't afford
But for what its worth Im ready to pay for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

[Beat break]

I got one life to live, Imma party 'til im dead
What the hell is a life worth living if its not on the edge
Try'na keep my balance Im twisted so just in case I fall
Written on my tombstone, should read women, weed and alcohol

Got somewhere to go but the world is moving slow
I was born for the fast life
I go for broke a lesson I can't afford
But for what its worth Im ready to pay for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

[Beat break]

If you live for something, youre not alone, my friend
So fill up your cup and lift your lighter, and toast to life

Im stuck in this moment, freeze the hands of my time
'Cause I feel inner peace when Im outta my mind
And you can call me crazy but I like to roll the dice
So Im willing to bet that Imma be crazy for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
