You think you're the new Sexy,
In a white Mercedes that bends me to the grave.
You make casual messy,
And all materials possess you like a slave,
You're custom-made.

Don't take this swim for more than it is,
Its one night, one night, one night.

Chew my love under your tongue
Like its your bubblegum
You're blowin bubbles till the taste is gone
You comin over for the night,
One night, one night, one night.
Chew my love under your tongue
Like its your bubblegum.
Just spit me out when it becomes more than fun.
Cause I'm comin over for the night,
One night, one night, one night.

Conversation is violent.
Baby you're too digital,
8-bit dated physical
But keep me under you're ceiling.
Cause you're concretes cheaper and
crumbling like me like grease on me, oh no.

Don't take this swim for more than it is,
Its one night, one night, one night.

Chew my love under your tongue
Like its your bubblegum
You're blowin bubbles till the taste is gone
You comin over for the night,
One night, one night, one night.
Chew my love under your tongue
Like its your bubblegum.
Just spit me out when it becomes more than fun.
Cause I'm comin over for the night,
One night, one night, one night.

Now, Ill pull you in close
Its a sweet and sour high,
When you promise not to try,
You have a promise that I lie,
We can drink the punch for this one last time,
Just one more last time.

Chew my love (chew my love) under your tongue
Like its your bubblegum (bubblegum)
You're blowin bubbles till the taste is gone
You comin over for the night,
One night, one night, one night.
Chew my love under your tongue
Like its your bubblegum.
Just spit me out when it becomes more than fun.
Cause I'm comin over for the night,
One night, one night, one night
One night, one night, one night
One night.

Just spit me out when it becomes more than fun.
