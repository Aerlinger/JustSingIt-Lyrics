I wanted love, I needed love
Most of all, most of all
Someone said true love was dead
And I'm bound to fall, bound to fall for you

Oh, what can I do? Yeah

Take my badge but my heart remains
Loving you, baby child
Tighten up on your reigns
You're running wild, running wild, it's true

Sick for days, so many ways
I'm aching now, I'm aching now
It's times like these, I need relief
Please show me how, oh, show me how

To get right, yes, out of sight

When I was young and moving fast
Nothing slowed me down, oh, slowed me down
Now I let the others pass
I've come around, oh, come around, 'cause I've found

Living just to keep going
Going just to be sane
All the while I know
It's such a shame

I don't need to get steady
I know just how I feel
Telling you to be ready
My dear
