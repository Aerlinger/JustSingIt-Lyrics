Baby here I am
I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you gotta' come home with me

I have got some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You gotta' come back for more

Boys and things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now
Gets around

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of great experience
I know you've got another man
But I can love you better than him

Take my hand don't be afraid
I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free
So you can place your ad with me

Boys come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but ten cent lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now
Gets around
Yeah
Hard to handle, now
Oh baby

Baby here I am
I'm the man on your scene
I can give you what you want
But you gotta' come home with me

I have got some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You gotta' come and back for more

Boys and things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now
Gets around
Hard
Hard to handle now
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Boys come along a dime by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but ten cent lovin'
Hey little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle, now
Gets around
Yeah
Oh Hard to handle now
Oh yeah

Baby, good lovin'
Baby, baby
Oh, oh good lovin'
I need good lovin'
I gotto handle yeah
Haa, yeah
