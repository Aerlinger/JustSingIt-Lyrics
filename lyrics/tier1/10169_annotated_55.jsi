27 Spend all your time waiting22 For that second chance35 For a break that would make it okay26 There's always some reason23 To feel not good enough35 And it's hard at the end of the day0 23 I need some distraction20 Oh beautiful release27 Memories seep from my veins15 Let me be empty27 Oh and weightless and maybe28 I'll find some peace tonight0 24 In the arms of the angel18 Fly away from here30 From this dark cold hotel room33 And the endlessness that you fear0 32 You are pulled from the wreckage22 Of your silent reverie31 You're in the arms of the angel30 May you find some comfort here0 29 So tired of the straight line23 And everywhere you turn* 41 There's vultures and thieves at your back27 The storm keeps on twisting25 Keep on building the lies38 That you make up for all that you lack0 27 It don't make no difference22 Escaping one last time22 It's easier to believe21 In this sweet madness24 Oh this glorious sadness26 That brings me to my knees0 24 In the arms of the angel18 Fly away from here30 From this dark cold hotel room33 And the endlessness that you fear0 32 You are pulled from the wreckage22 Of your silent reverie31 You're in the arms of the angel30 May you find some comfort here0 31 You're in the arms of the angel33 May you find some comfort here :)0 11 Songwriters16 MCLACHLAN, SARAH0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 55 Read more: Sarah McLachlan - Angel Lyrics | MetroLyrics
