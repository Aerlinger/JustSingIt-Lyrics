Oh, yeah
Lets go
I wanna tell you my secret
With just the sound of my breathing
I wanna know your hearts beating
I wanna tell you
I wanna tell you

Oh, like that
It feels so good that I cant hold back
Ooh, like that
Hit the right spot, making my eyes roll back

Let there be, let there be love
Here in the, here in the dark
Turning me, turning me on
Not gonna fight anymore
Cause I want your touch

Let there be, let there be love
Here in the, here in the dark
Turning me, turning me on
Not gonna fight anymore
Cause I want your touch

I want you to tell me you need it
I want to hear it repeated
Want you to take me completely
Want you to tell me
Want you to tell me

Oh, like that
It feels so good that I cant hold back
Ooh, sound like that
Hit the right spot, making my eyes roll back

Let there be, let there be love
Here in the, here in the dark
Turning me, turning me on
Not gonna fight anymore
Cause I want your touch

Let there be, let there be love
Here in the, here in the dark
Turning me, turning me on
Not gonna fight anymore
Cause I want your touch

Let there be, let there be love
Let there be, let there be love
Let there be, let there be love
Let there be, let there be love

Oh, whoa, lets go
Let there be love
Oh, yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah!

Let there be, let there be love
Here in the, here in the dark
Turning me, turning me on
Not gonna anymore
Cause I want your touch

Let there be, let there be love
Here in the, here in the dark
Turning me, turning me on
Not gonna fight anymore
Cause I want your touch
