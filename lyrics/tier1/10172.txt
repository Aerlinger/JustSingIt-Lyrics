Somebody call 911!
Shawty fire burning on the dance floor, whoa
(Fire burning, fire burning)
What a gwaan!
Kingston, let's go, hey!
RedOne, hey, hey

Shawty got that super thing
Hotter than the sun in the south in Spain
Got me soon as I walked through the door

My pocket started tickling
The way she drop it low, that thang
Got me wan' spend my money on her, her

She get it, pop it, lock it, drop it, that birthday cake
Got a candle, need to blow that crazy flame away
Now take my red, black card and my jewelry
Shawty is cool like the fire, cool like fire

Somebody call 911!
Shawty fire burning on the dance floor, whoa
I gotta cool her down
She wan' bring the roof to ground
On the dance floor, whoa

She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawty's fire burning on the dance floor
She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawty's fire burning on the dance floor
(Fire burning, fire burning)

That body is a masterpiece
The order is one in every hundred years
But ain't no doubt I'm taking it home, home

I'm afraid we'll blow them legs
Little mama game is about to change
She'll be on covers over the world

She get it, pop it, lock it, drop it, that birthday cake
Got a candle, need to blow that crazy flame away
Now take my red, black card and my jewelry
Shawty is cool like the fire, cool like fire

Somebody call 911!
Shawty fire burning on the dance floor, whoa
I gotta cool her down
She wan' bring the roof to ground
On the dance floor, whoa

She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawty's fire burning on the dance floor
She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawty's fire burning on the dance floor

She got that fire in the dance
That'll make them fellas run around, hey!
No exit from the dance floor
So them boys wan' more, hey!

She got that fire in the dance
That'll make them fellas run around
(Madem, get out my way, everybody, sing it now, hey!)
No exit from the dance floor
So them boys wan' more
(What a gwaan? Let's go! Madem, let's go, hey!)

She get it, pop it, lock it, drop it, that birthday cake
Got a candle, need to blow that crazy flame away
Now take my red, black card and my jewelry
Shawty is cool like the fire, cool like fire

Somebody call 911!
Shawty fire burning on the dance floor, whoa
I gotta cool her down
She wan' bring the roof to ground
On the dance floor, whoa

She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawty's fire burning on the dance floor
She's fire burning, fire burning on the dance floor
That little shawty's fire burning on the dance floor

Somebody call 911!
