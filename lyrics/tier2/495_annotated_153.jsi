* 50 I know there's something in the wake of your smile* 46 I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea* 45 You've built a love but that love falls apart* 41 Your little piece of heaven turns to dark0 20 Listen to your heart25 When he's calling for you20 Listen to your heart31 There's nothing else you can do0 31 I don't know where you're going20 And I don't know why24 But listen to your heart27 Before you tell him goodbye0 * 48 Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile* 50 The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea* 47 They're swept away and nothing is what is seems39 The feeling of belonging to your dreams0 20 Listen to your heart25 When he's calling for you20 Listen to your heart31 There's nothing else you can do0 31 I don't know where you're going20 And I don't know why24 But listen to your heart27 Before you tell him goodbye0 20 And there are voices21 That want to be heard18 So much to mention28 But you can't find the words18 The scent of magic22 The beauty that's been34 When love was wilder than the wind0 20 Listen to your heart25 When he's calling for you20 Listen to your heart31 There's nothing else you can do0 31 I don't know where you're going20 And I don't know why24 But listen to your heart27 Before you tell him goodbye33 Listen to your heart, mmm, mmmmmm0 31 I don't know where you're going20 And I don't know why24 But listen to your heart27 Before you tell him goodbye0 11 Songwriters* 61 AITKEN, MATTHEW JAMES / WATERMAN, PETER ALAN / STOCK, MICHAEL0 12 Published by* 153 Lyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Group, Warner/Chappell Music, Inc., Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd., Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, EMI Music Publishing0 0 0 * 58 Read more: DHT - Listen To Your Heart Lyrics | MetroLyrics
