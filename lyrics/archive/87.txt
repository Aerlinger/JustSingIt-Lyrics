	<li><p>Oh, it's so sexy y'all</p></li>
	<li><p>I don't know where you're going</p></li>
	<li><p>Or when you're coming home</p></li>
	<li><p>I left the keys under the mat to our front door</p></li>
	<li><p>For one more chance to hold you close</p></li>
	<li><p>I don't know where you're going</p></li>
	<li><p>Just get your ass back home</p></li>
	<li><p>We both knew this type of life</p></li>
	<li><p>Didn't come with instructions</p></li>
	<li><p>So I'm trying to do my best</p></li>
	<li><p>To make something outta nothing</p></li>
	<li><p>And sometimes it gets</p></li>
	<li><p>Downright shitty in fact</p></li>
	<li><p>When you call and I don't even know</p></li>
	<li><p>What city I'm at</p></li>
	<li><p>Or what day of the week in the middle of the month</p></li>
	<li><p>In a year I don't recall</p></li>
	<li><p>It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke</p></li>
	<li><p>I told you I wouldn't be long</p></li>
	<li><p>That was last November now December's almost gone</p></li>
	<li><p>I'd apologize but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong</p></li>
	<li><p>I don't know where you're going</p></li>
	<li><p>Or when you're coming home</p></li>

	<li><p>Just get your ass back home</p></li>
	<li><p>And you been nothing but amazing</p></li>
	<li><p>And I never take that for granted</p></li>
	<li><p>Half of these birds would have flew</p></li>
	<li><p>To coop but you, you truly understand it</p></li>
	<li><p>And the fact you stood beside me</p></li>
	<li><p>Every time you heard some bogusness</p></li>
	<li><p>You deserve a standing o</p></li>
	<li><p>'Cause they'd a just been over it</p></li>
	<li><p>Let em talk, let em talk, let em talk, let em talk</p></li>
	<li><p>Like we don't hear what they saying</p></li>
	<li><p>Let em walk, let em walk, let em walk, let em walk</p></li>
	<li><p>We'll just drive by and keep waving</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause you and I above all that</p></li>
	<li><p>Just let em wallow in it</p></li>
	<li><p>Now they all choked up, yuck</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause they be swallowing it</p></li>
	<li><p>I don't know where you're going</p></li>
	<li><p>Or when you're coming home</p></li>
	<li><p>I left the keys under the mat to our front door</p></li>
