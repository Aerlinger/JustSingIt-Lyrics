[:chorus:]
I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that i'm lovin' you

Oh, oh, i never felt this way
How do you give me so much pleasure and cause me so much pain?
Just when i think i've taken more than would a fool
I start fallin' back in love with you

[:chorus:]
I keep on fallin'
In and out of love with you
I never loved someone
The way that i'm lovin' you
