33 I was raised off of Rural Route 332 Out past where the blacktop ends37 We'd walk to church on Sunday morning37 Race barefoot back to Johnson's fence0 29 That's where I first saw Mary37 On that roadside picking blackberries40 That summer I turned a corner in my soul23 Down that red dirt road0 8 [Chorus]32 It's where I drank my first beer24 It's where I found Jesus29 Where I wrecked my first car,23 I tore it all to pieces28 I learned the path to heaven32 Is full of sinners and believers31 Learned that happiness on earth29 Ain't just for high achievers13 I've learned,17 I've come to know25 There's life at both ends21 Of that red dirt road0 29 Her daddy didn't like me much21 In my shackled up GTO40 I'd sneak out in the middle of the night33 Throw rocks at her bedroom window0 28 We'd turn out the headlights22 Drive by the moonlight37 Talk about what the future might hold23 Down that red dirt road0 8 [Chorus]0 25 I went out into the world18 And I came back in12 I lost Mary,23 Oh I got her back again25 And driving home tonight,40 Feels like I've found a long lost friend0 8 [Chorus]0 11 Songwriters26 BROOKS, KIX / DUNN, RONNIE0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 61 Read more: Brooks & Dunn - Red Dirt Road Lyrics | MetroLyrics
