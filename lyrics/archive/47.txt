Take me off the sidelines
Blow sand beneath my feet
Break me out this gilded cage that holds me

Come fill my veins with sunlight
Send a postcard from my lungs
I wanna taste salvation on my tongue

The goal - control
And I won’t waste a second more
Can you hear what I’m thinking of?

You gotta hold on tight, we’re going up
And I know I want it hard enough

Raging like a rebel
There’s a riot in my streets
Come feel the revolution in my heartbeat

Now push me down the runway
And serenade my climb
It’s time to leave this star-crossed world behind

The goal: control
And I won’t waste a second more
Can you feel what I’m thinking of?

You gotta hold on tight, we’re going up
And I know I want it hard enough

And Mary when you see me rise
Fading in a distant skyline
Know I’ll be back for you
