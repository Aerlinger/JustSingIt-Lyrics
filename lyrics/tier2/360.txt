Konvict, Konvict Muzik
And you know we upfront

I see you winding and grinding up on that floor
I know you see me lookin' at you when you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know, girl

Money in the air that's mo' fair, grab you by your coat tail
Take you to the motel, wholesale
Don't tell, won't tell, baby say I don't talk dog
But she told on me, oh well

Take a picture with me, what the flick gon' do?
Baby stick to me and I'ma stick on you
If you pick me then I'ma pick on you
D-O-double-G and I'm here to put this **** on you

I'm stuck on ***** and yours is right
Rip ride on those floors and those doors is tight
And I'ma get me a shot 'for the end of the night
'Cause ***** is ***** and baby you're ***** for life

I see you winding and grinding up on that floor
I know you see me lookin' at you when you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know, girl

Shorty I can see you ain't lonely
Handful of niggers and they all got G's
So you lookin' at me now what it's gonna be
Just another a tease far as I can see

Trying to get you up out this club
If it means spendin' a couple dubs
Throwin' about 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that
'Cause I'm far from a scrub

And you know my pedigree
Ex-deala used to move 'phetamines
Girl I spend money like it don't mean nothing
And besides I got a thing for you

I see you winding and grinding up on that floor
I know you see me lookin' at you when you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know, girl

Mobbin' through the club in the low pressin'
I'm sittin' in the back in the smoker section
Birds eye, I got a clear view
You can't see me but I can see you

It's cool we jet, the mood is set, your ***** is so wet
You're rubbin' your back and touchin' your neck
Your body is movin', you're humpin' and jumpin', your ****** is bouncin'
You're smilin' and grinning and lookin' at me

Girl and while you lookin' at me, I'm ready to hit the catty
Right up on the patio, move the patty to the catty
Baby you got a fatty, the type I like to marry
Wanting to just give you everything and thats kinda scary

'Cause I'm lovin' the way you shake your ass
Bouncin' got me tippin' my glass
Normally don't get caught up too fast
But I got a thing for you

I see you winding and grinding up on that floor
I know you see me lookin' at you when you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know

I see you winding and grinding up on that floor
I know you see me lookin' at you when you already know
I wanna love you, you already know
I wanna love you, you already know, girl
