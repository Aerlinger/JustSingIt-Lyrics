I'm gonna be here for you baby
I'll be a man of my word
Speak the language in a voice
That you have never heard

I wanna sleep with you forever
And I wanna die in your arms
In a cabin by a meadow
Where the wild bees swarm

And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Makin' memories of us

I wanna honor your mother
And I wanna learn from your pa
I wanna steal your attention
Like a bad outlaw

And I wanna stand out in a crowd for you
A man among men
I wanna make your world better
Than it's ever been

And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Makin' memories of us

We'll follow the rainbow
Wherever the four winds blow
And there'll be a new day
Comin' your way

I'm gonna be here for you from now on
This you know somehow
You've been stretched to the limits
But it's alright now

And I'm gonna make you a promise
If there's life after this
I'm gonna be there to meet you
With a warm, wet kiss

And I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll earn your trust
Makin' memories of us

I'm gonna love you
Like nobody loves you
And I'll win your trust
Makin' memories of us
