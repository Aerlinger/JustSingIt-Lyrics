I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more shotty,
I bet a lot of me was lost, 'T's uncrossed and 'I's undotted,
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got,
Not anymore, flesh out the door, swat,

I must've forgot, you can't trust me,
I'm open a moment and close when you show it before you know it I'm lost at sea,
And now that I write and think about it, and the story unfolds,
You should take my life, you should take my soul.

You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,
You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

And I'll be holding on to you [x2]

Remember the moment you know exactly where you're going,
'Cause the next moment, before you know it, time is slowing and it's frozen still,
And the window sill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?

Fight it, take the pain, ignite it,
Tie a noose around your mind loose enough to breathe fine and tie it to a tree,
Tell it, "You belong to me,
This ain't a noose, this is a leash,
I have news for you, you must obey me."

You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain,
You are surrounding all my surroundings,
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes.

Entertain my faith [x10]

[x4:]
Lean with it, rock with it,
When we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothing, we were gifted with thought,
Is it time to move our feet to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat.

And I'll be holding on to you.
And I'll be holding on to you.
And I'll be holding on to you.
And I'll be holding on to you.
And I'll be holding on to you.
And I'll be holding on to you.
And I'll be holding on to you.
And I'll be holding on to you!
