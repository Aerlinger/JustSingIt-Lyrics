I'm gonna pick up the pieces,
And build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings,
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend you and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend you and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you get down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you get down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you get down
And out of all these things I've done I will love you better now
