Murda Inc
(Ha, ha)
It must be the ass that got me like damn
If it get any fatter man the Rule gonna have to get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners

J to tha L O, hello, no I'm not be harmin' y'alls wall
I'm the Rule in the shot call off the wall
Like MJ in his early days
It's the INC and Lopez now

Ain't that funny, it's been a while since you came around
Now ya wanna see what's goin' down
Tryin' to tell me how you want my time
Tryin' to tell me how I'm on your mind
(On your mind)

See it never had to be this way
You should've never played the games you played
Now I'm seein' that you're kinda lame
Knowin' how the situation changed

Ain't that funny
(Ain't it funny)
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say

Ain't that funny
(Ain't it funny)
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny

I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're lookin' like a lonely man
(Lonely man)

I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurtin' 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

Ain't that funny
(Ain't it funny)
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say

Ain't that funny
(Ain't it funny)
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny

C A double D, hi, double dose ma
Fly by, red line, touch the roast side
Oh I, never been a sucker for choke cha [unverified]
Spit the ism, hit 'em, get rid of 'em

And you know Tah get it gully, and ain't that funny
How they want me, see me workin' wit money
But Caddy ain't a dummy, what these brodies want from me?
'Cause all I got is G, JLo and Murda I N C

I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Tryin' to make me sit and reminisce
Tryin' to blind me with your blingin' bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing
(Cost a thing)

Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever wanna hear from you
I had enough of bein' there for you
Now I'm laughin' why you play the fool

Ain't that funny
(Ain't it funny)
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, now I can smile and say

Ain't that funny
(Ain't it funny)
Baby that you want me, when you had me
Love is crazy, I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny

Baby, is that your girlfriend
I got my boyfriend
Maybe we can be friends
Na, na, na, na, na

Baby, I got my boyfriend
Is that your girlfriend
But maybe we can be friends
Na, na, na, na, na
