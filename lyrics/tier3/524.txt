These words are my own

Threw some chords together
The combination D-E-F
Is who I am, is what I do
And I was gonna lay it down for you

I try to focus my attention
But I feel so A.D.D.
I need some help, some inspiration
But it's not coming easily

Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic
Don't you know, don't you know, don't you know

Waste bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

There's no other way
To better say
I love you, love you, love you

Read some Byron, Shelley and Keats
Recited it over a hip-hop beat
I'm having trouble saying what I mean
With dead poets and drum machines

You know I had some studio time booked
But I couldn't find the killer hook
Now you've gone and raised the bar right up
Nothing I write is ever good enough

These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

There's no other way
To better say
I love you, I love you, I love you

These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

There's no other way
To better say
I love you, love you

I'm getting off my stage
The curtains pull away
No hyperbole to hide behind
My naked soul exposes

Trying to find the magic
Trying to write a classic
Waste bin full of paper
Clever rhymes, see you later

These words are my own
From my heart flown
Don't you know?
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

There's no other way
To better say
I love you, love you, I love you

These words are my own
From my heart flown
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

There's no other way
To better say
I love you, love you, I love you

These words are my own
They're from my heart
I love you, I love you

That's all I've got to say
Can't think of a better way
And that's all I've got to say
I love you, is that okay?
