Legendary Child
Ill tell you what Im talking about (uh)
Makin' love at seventeen, yeah we had the luck
But we traded dem toys for other joys
Yeah we didnt give a (whoa-oa-oa-whoa)
I took a chance at the high school dance
Never knowing wrong from right
And that same show 40 years ago
Being televised tonight
Coz getting from inside my head to the Taj Mahal
I went from never having none to wanna have it all
I wanna keep that dream alive
And eat that honey from the hive
What's all the noise and all the clamor
No Surprize, you know I am a
Legendary Child
I think a what Im tryin' to say
Is
Sticks and stones'll break your bones
At least theyll rearrange
Ill drop a dime, and every time
I get myself a nickels change
They say we dont know Jack
At The Plant we proved them wrong
We traded in our soul tonight
and sold them for a song
And if Satan had a lady friend her name was Mary Jane
I never wondered why she tried to drive us quite insane
And how we got that golden fleece
From tokin' on that pipe of peace
But yea as far as I can see
There is a God coz I got me a
Legendary Child
Legendary Child
Legendary Child
Legendary Child
Legendary Child
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Legen-whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Legendary Child (whoa) (whoa) (whoa) (whoa)
Legendary (whoa) (whoa) (whoa) (oh)
