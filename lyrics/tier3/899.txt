Go go go

Year of the rat last of the litter
Somebody shot the babysitter
They say my middle name is "Danger"
The guy you keep away from strangers

Im singing woah oh oh oh oh
Im out of control
Oh baby, when I see your pretty face
I say woah oh oh oh oh
God rest your fucking soul
'Cause baby, baby I was born to kill

I pulled the trigger from the shooting stars
I am the motor in your crashing car
I am the Cherub in the arab spring
I the bullet in your magazine

Im singing woah oh oh oh oh
Im out of control
Oh baby, when I see your pretty face
I said oh oh oh oh oh
God rest your fucking soul
'Cause baby, baby eyes
'Cause baby, baby eyes
'Cause baby, baby I was born to kill
