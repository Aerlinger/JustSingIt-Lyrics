Oo my song says it all to you hear all over
Ooo I come home
When you see on my face, see on my face
'aint gonna a second to waist to one move
'aint gonna a second to waist to one move
'aint gonna a second to waist to one move
The morning my .
Always hated that moment
It's been sweet in my mind trust as we face on sadness

Oo my song says it all to you hear all over
'aint gonna a second to waist to one move
'aint gonna a second to waist to one move
'aint gonna a second to waist to one move
Oooo
Uuuu uuuu
We've call this based together last speald
