It's complicated, it always is
That's just the way it goes
Feels like I've waited so long for this
I wonder if it shows?

Head underwater, now I can't breath
It never felt so good
'Cause I can feel it coming over me
I wouldn't stop it if I could

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight

Give me a reason, I gotta know
Do you feel it too?
Can't you see me here on overload?
And this time I blame you

Mm, looking out for you to hold my hand
It feels like I could fall
Now love me right like I know you can
We could lose it all

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight

Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

And I'll be loving you all the time, it's true
'Cause I want to make it right with you

When love takes over, when love takes over
When love takes over, when love takes over
When love takes over, when love takes over
When love takes over, over, over, over, over, over
Over, over, over, over, over

When love takes over, yeah
You know you can't deny
When love takes over, yeah
'Cause something's here tonight
