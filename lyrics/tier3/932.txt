My heart will never feel,
Will never see, Will never know,
Oh heart, and then it falls,
and then I fall, and then I know,
My heart will never feel,
Will never see, Will never know,
Oh heart, and then it falls,
and then I fall, and then I know.
My heart will never feel,
Will never see, Will never know,
Oh heart, and then it falls,
and then I fall, and then I know,
My heart will never feel,
Will never see, Will never know,
Oh heart, and then it falls,
and then I fall, and then I know.
Home and I know,
Playing the deck of cards,
It's always different,
I am the one in love,
Home and I know,
Playing the deck of cards,
It's always different,
I am the one in love.

Boucher, Claire Elise
