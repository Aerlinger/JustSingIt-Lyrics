15 Pop a top again37 I've just got time for one more round38 Set 'em up my friend then I'll be gone40 And you can let some other fool sit down* 50 I'd like for you to listen to a joke I heard today* 60 From a woman who said she was through and calmly walked away* 59 I tried to smile and did awhile but it felt so out of place* 68 Did you ever hear of a clown with teardrops streamin' down his face?19 And pop a top again31 I think I'll have another round38 Set 'em up my friend then I'll be gone40 And you can let some other fool sit down* 47 Home for me is misery and here I'm wastin' time* 65 'Cause a row of fools on a row of stools is not what's on my mind* 52 But then you see her leaving me is not what I prefer* 62 So it's either here just drinkin' beer or home remembering her15 Pop a top again31 I think I'll have another round38 Set 'em up my friend then I'll be gone40 And you can let some other fool sit down15 Pop a top again0 11 Songwriters12 STUCKEY, NAT0 12 Published by40 Lyrics ï¿½ Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 56 Read more: Alan Jackson - Pop A Top Lyrics | MetroLyrics
