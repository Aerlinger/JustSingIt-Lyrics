I dedicate this record the carnival to all you brothers takin' long trips
Down south, Virginia, Baltimore all round the world
And your girl gets this message that you ain't comin' back
She sittin' back in her room, da lights is off
She's cryin', and then my voice comes in pow
And in the middle of the night and this is what I tell her for you

Every time I make a run, girl you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why?
See you must understand I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone till November

Said I'll be gone till November, I'll be gone till November
You tell my girl I'll be gone till November, I'll be gone till November
I'll be gone 'til November, you tell my girl yo I'll be gone till November

January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin' but girl I can't stay
I'll be gone till November, I'll be gone till November
And give a kiss to my motha

When I come back there be no time to clock
I'll have enough money to buy out the glocks
Tell my brotha go to school in September
So he won't mess up in summer school in da summer

Tell my cousin Jerry wear his condom
If you don't wear condom you see a red line
Oh, you sucka M.C's you got no flow
I heard ya style you S O, S O

Every time I make a run, girl you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why?
See you must understand I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone till November

Said I'll be gone till November I'll be gone till November
You tell my girl I'll be gone till November, I'll be gone till November
I'll be gone 'til November, you tell my girl yo I'll be gone till November

January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin' but girl I can't stay
I'll be gone till November, I'll be gone till November
And give a kiss to my motha

I had to flick nothin' and turn it in to somethin'
Hip-Hop turns to the future of rock when I smash a pumpkin
Commit treason now I have a reason
To hunt you down it's only right its rappers season, yeah you

With the loud voice posin' like your top choice
I make a hertz out of ya rolls Royce
Besides I got my girl to remember and I committed that
I'll be back in November

Every time I make a run, girl you turn around and cry
I ask myself why, oh why?
See you must understand I can't work a 9 to 5
So I'll be gone till November

Said I'll be gone till November I'll be gone till November
You tell my girl I'll be gone till November, I'll be gone till November
I'll be gone 'til November, you tell my girl yo I'll be gone till November

January, February, March, April, May
I see you cryin' but girl I can't stay
I'll be gone till November, I'll be gone till November
And give a kiss to my motha
I know the hustles hard, but we gotta enterprise, the carnival
