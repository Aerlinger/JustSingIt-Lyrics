Work it, make it, do it, makes us
Harder, better, faster, stronger

(Work it harder, make it better)
N-n-now that that don't kill me
(Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Can only make me stronger
(More than ever ever after)
I need you to hurry up now
(Our work is never over)
Cause I can't wait much longer

(Work it harder, make it better)
I know I got to be right now
(Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Cause I cant get much wronger
(More than ever ever after)
Man Ive been waitin' all night now
(Our work is never over)
That's how long Ive been on ya

Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
(I need you right now)
More than ever ever after
Our work is
(I need you right now)

Lets get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a f*** what they all say, right?

Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
@#$% they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real **** anymore?

Bow in the presence of greatness
Cause right now thou has forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake sh**

So go ahead go nuts, go ape sh**
Specially in my Pastel and my Bape sh**
Act like you can't tell who made this new gospel
Homey take six and take this, haters

(Work it harder, make it better)
N-n-now that that don't kill me
(Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Can only make me stronger
(More than ever ever after)
I need you to hurry up now
(Our work is never over)
Cause I can't wait much longer

(Work it harder, make it better)
I know I got to be right now
(Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Cause I cant get much wronger
(More than ever ever after)
Man Ive been waitin' all night now
(Our work is never over)
That's how long Ive been on ya

Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
(I need you right now)
More than ever ever after
Our work is
(I need you right now)
(Me likey)

I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in ya plans or not
I'm trippin', this drink got me sayin' a lot

But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the @#$% could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin' I'm caught up in the moment, right?

'Cause this is Louis Vuitton dime night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well Id do anything for a blonde ****

And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby you're makin' it
(Harder, better, faster, stronger)

(Work it harder, make it better)
N-n-now that that don't kill me
(Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Can only make me stronger
(More than ever ever after)
I need you to hurry up now
(Our work is never over)
Cause I can't wait much longer

(Work it harder, make it better)
I know I got to be right now
(Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Cause I cant get much wronger
(More than ever ever after)
Man Ive been waitin' all night now
(Our work is never over)
That's how long Ive been on ya

Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
(I need you right now)
More than ever ever after
Our work is
(I need you right now)

You know how long Ive been on ya?
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since OJ had isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya

Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya

Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Uh, baby you're making it
(Harder, better, faster, stronger)

(Work it harder, make it better)
N-n-now that that don't kill me
(Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Can only make me stronger
(More than ever ever after)
I need you to hurry up now
(Our work is never over)
Cause I can't wait much longer

(Work it harder, make it better)
I know I got to be right now
(Do it faster, makes us stronger)
Cause I cant get much wronger
(More than ever ever after)
Man Ive been waitin' all night now
(Our work is never over)
That's how long Ive been on ya

Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
(I need you right now)
More than ever ever after
Our work is
(I need you right now)

Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
(I need you right now)
More than ever ever after
Our work is
(I need you right now)

You know how long Ive been on ya?
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since OJ had isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya

You know how long Ive been on ya?
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since OJ had isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya
