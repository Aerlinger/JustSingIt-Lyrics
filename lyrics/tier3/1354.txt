Pretty girls come from the ugliest places
You come from the worst of them all
Heartbreakers like you are hard to erase
You lift me up just so I fall

I followed you all the way down to the coast
And we kissed under traveling skies
I wish I had seen what was coming for me
But you wear such a lovely disguise

Hey, you got a restless heart
Beat it out, out, out, out on your sleeve
And I won't let this fire start
You say love is all that you need
Well you're not gonna get it from me

Oh, Oh
No you're not gonna get it from me

You say that you wanted a lover
Someone to cover your head when it rains
But even a hopeless romantic like me
Yeah I know that it's all just a game

Everyone's looking for love
Looking for something to hold on to
Oh I've been looking for 25 years
and I know I won't find it in you

Hey, you got a restless heart
Beat it out, out, out, out on your sleeve
And I won't let this fire start
You say love is all that you need
Well you're not gonna get it from me

Oh, Oh
No you're not gonna get it from me

I won't let you break my heart
I won't let you break
I won't let you break my heart

Pretty girls come from the ugliest places
You come from the worst of them all
Heartbreakers like you are hard to erase
You lift me up just so I fall

Hey you got a restless heart
Beat it out, out, out, out on your sleeve
And I won't let this fire start
You say love is all that you need
Well you're not gonna get it from me

Hey you got a restless heart
Beat it out, out, out, out on your sleeve
And I won't let this fire start
You say love is all that you need
Well you're not gonna get it from me

Ooo, Ooo
No you're not gonna get it from me
Ooo, Ooo
No you're not gonna get it from me

I won't let you break
I won't let you break my heart
No you're not gonna get it from me

I won't let you break
I won't let you break my heart
No you're not gonna get it from me
