I wish I was blank
I wish I was blank
I wish I could thank
I wish I was blank

I write a letter to you
And there'd be nothing to it
I wouldn't hem and haw
On just how to start it

I wish I was blank
I wish I was blank
I wish I could thank
I wish I was blank

I wish I'd stand up straight
I wish I'd said things different
I wish I'd said nothing
Things would be so perfect

I wish myself to keep
I pray myself to sleep
I wish myself away
I wish I was blank
