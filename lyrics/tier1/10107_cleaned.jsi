I hope the ring you gave to her
Turns her finger green
I hope when youre in bed with her
You think of me

I would never wish bad things
But I dont wish you well
Could you tell
By the flames that burned your words?

I never read your letter
'Cause I knew what youd say
Give me that Sunday school answer
Try and make it all okay

Does it hurt
To know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks
To see my face everywhere

It was you
Who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know

You knew
Exactly what you would do
Dont say
You simply lost your way

She may believe you
But I never will
Never again

If she really knows the truth
She deserves you
A trophy wife, oh how cute

Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes
And hes through with you
And @#$% be through with you
Youll die together but alone

You wrote me in a letter
You couldnt say it right to my face
Well give me that Sunday school answer
Repent yourself away

Does it hurt
To know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks
To see my face everywhere

It was you
Who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know

You knew
Exactly what you would do
And dont say
You simply lost your way

They may believe you
But I never will
Never again

Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you
Never

Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you
Never

Does it hurt
To know I'll never be there?
Bet it sucks
To see my face everywhere

It was you
Who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know

You knew
Exactly what you would do
And dont say
You simply lost your way

They may believe you
But I never will
I never will
I never will
Never again
