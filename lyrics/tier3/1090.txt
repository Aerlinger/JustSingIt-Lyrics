Feel the adrenaline moving under my skin
It's an addiction, such an eruption
Sound is my remedy, feeding me energy
Music is all I need

Baby I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care
(Feel it in the air, yeah)

She's a mean and crazy dicta
Disco diva, and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

Back on the dance floor, better not to take me home
Bass kicking so hot, blazing through my beating heart
French kissing on the floor, party's gettin' hardcore
Everybody is getting a little tipsy off the crazy goofs
This will end up in the news

Baby I just wanna dance
I don't really care
I just wanna dance
I don't really care, care, care
(Feel it in the air, yeah)

She's a mean and crazy dicta
Disco diva, and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?

I'll try to sex you while the night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up, oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum

I'll try to sex you while the night has got me love sprung
I won't stop until the sun is up, oh yeah
My heart is a dancer beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum, beating like a disco drum
Beating like a disco drum

She's a mean and crazy dicta
Disco diva, and you wonder
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Who's that chick? Who's that chick?
