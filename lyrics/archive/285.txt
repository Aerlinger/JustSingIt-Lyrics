	<li><p>Say you're sorry</p></li>
	<li><p>That face of an angel</p></li>
	<li><p>Comes out just when you need it to</p></li>
	<li><p>As I pace back and forth all this time</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause I honestly believed in you</p></li>
	<li><p>Holding on, the days drag on</p></li>
	<li><p>Stupid girl, I should have known, I should have known</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm not a princess</p></li>
	<li><p>This ain't a fairy tale</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet</p></li>
	<li><p>Lead her up the stairwell</p></li>
	<li><p>This ain't Hollywood</p></li>
	<li><p>This is a small town</p></li>
	<li><p>I was a dreamer before you went and let me down</p></li>
	<li><p>Now it's too late for you and your white horse</p></li>
	<li><p>To come around</p></li>
	<li><p>Maybe I was naive</p></li>
	<li><p>Got lost in your eyes</p></li>
	<li><p>And never really had a chance</p></li>
	<li><p>My mistake, I didn't know to be in love</p></li>
	<li><p>You had to fight to have the upper hand</p></li>
	<li><p>I had so many dreams about you and me</p></li>
	<li><p>Happy endings</p></li>
	<li><p>Now I know</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm not a princess</p></li>
	<li><p>This ain't a fairy tale</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet</p></li>
	<li><p>Lead her up the stairwell</p></li>
	<li><p>This ain't Hollywood</p></li>
	<li><p>This is a small town</p></li>
	<li><p>I was a dreamer before you went and let me down</p></li>
	<li><p>Now it's too late for you and your white horse</p></li>
	<li><p>To come around</p></li>
	<li><p>And there you are on your knees</p></li>
	<li><p>Begging for forgiveness</p></li>
	<li><p>Begging for me</p></li>
	<li><p>Just like I always wanted but I'm so sorry</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause I'm not your princess</p></li>
	<li><p>This ain't a fairytale</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well</p></li>
	<li><p>This is a big world</p></li>
	<li><p>That was a small town</p></li>
	<li><p>There in my rearview mirror disappearing now</p></li>
	<li><p>And its too late for you and your white horse</p></li>
	<li><p>Now its too late for you and your white horse</p></li>
	<li><p>To catch me now</p></li>
	<li><p>Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa</p></li>
	<li><p>Try and catch me now</p></li>
	<li><p>Oh, it's too late to catch me now</p></li>
