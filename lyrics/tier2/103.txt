I looked in my rearview mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us
I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
Cause I can be the death of us, the death of us, baby

You know how to drive in rain
You decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck
In bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
Cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was

When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, Constantly crazy
Can we get back to the way it was

Hey, What happened to the butterflies
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we found it
Well that's when we start turning around
You're saying baby don't worry
But we're still going the wrong way baby

You know how to drive in rain
You decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck
In bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
Cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was

When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was

They say only fools fall in love
But they must've been talking about us
Sometimes I feel like
I've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We gon' be lost
If we continue to fight
Honey I know
We can find our way home

I feel like my heart is stuck
In bumper to bumper
Traffic, I'm under pressure
Cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was

When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
My Baby, Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was

When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue
Baby, Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was

Baby, you know how to drive in rain
You decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Going the wrong way home

I feel like my heart is stuck
Traffic, I'm under
pre-pre-pressure,
Pressure
Let's just go back to the way it was

When we were on
Let's just go back
