I'm feeling like a star, you can't stop my shine
I'm lovin' cloud nine, my head's in the sky
I'm solo, I'm ridin' solo
I'm ridin' solo, I'm ridinâ€™ solo, solo
Yeah, I'm feelin' good tonight
Finally doing me and it feels so right, oh
Time to do the things I like
Going to the club everything's alright, oh
No one to answer to
No one that's gonna argue, no
And since I got that hold off me
I'm livin' life now that I'm free, yeah
Told me get my @#$% together
Now I got my @#$% together, yeah
Now I made it through the weather
Better days are gonna get better
I'm so sorry that it didn't work out
I'm movin' on
I'm so sorry but it's over now
The pain is gone
I'm puttin' on my shades to cover up my eyes
I'm jumpin' in my ride, I'm headin' out tonight
I'm solo, I'm ridin' solo
I'm ridin' solo, I'm ridin' solo, solo
I'm feelin' like a star, you can't stop my shine
I'm lovin' cloud nine, my head's in the sky
I'm solo, I'm ridin' solo
I'm ridin' solo, I'm ridin' solo, solo
Now I'm feelin' how I should
Never knew single could feel this good, oh
Stop playin' misunderstood
Back in the game, who knew I would, oh
So flat, I'm a spread my wings
Loving myself makes me wanna sing
Oh, oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Told me get my @#$% together
Now I got my @#$% together, yeah
Now I made it through the weather
Better days are gonna get better
I'm so sorry that it didn't work out
I'm movin' on
I'm so sorry but it's over now
The pain is gone
I'm puttin' on my shades to cover up my eyes
I'm jumpin' in my ride, I'm headin' out tonight
