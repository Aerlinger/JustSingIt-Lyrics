Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?

Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
What's my name? what's my name?

Yeah, I heard you good with them soft lips
Yeah you know word of mouth
The square root of 69 is 8 somethin', right?
'Cause I've been tryna work it out, oh

Good weed, white wine
I come alive in the night time
Okay, away we go
Only thing we have on is the radio

Let it play
Say you gotta leave, but I know you wanna stay
You just waiting on the traffic jam to finish, girl
The things that we could do in twenty minutes, girl

Say my name, say my name, wear it out
It's getting hot, crack a window, air it out
I can get you through a mighty long day
Soon as you go, the text that I write is gon' say

Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
What's my name? what's my name?

Not everybody
Knows how to work my body
Knows how to make me want it
But, boy, you stay up on it

You got that somethin'
That keeps me so off balance
Baby, you're a challenge
Let's explore your talent

Hey, boy, I really wanna see
If you can go long term with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type, oh, na, na, na, na

I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work
Uh oh
Oh

Hey, boy, I really wanna see
If you can go long term with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type, oh, na, na, na, na

I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work
Uh oh
Oh

Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
What's my name? what's my name?

Baby, you got me
And ain't nowhere that I'd be
Than with your arms around me
Back and forth you rock me

So I surrender
To every word you whisper
Every door you enter
I will let you in

Hey, boy, I really wanna see
If you can go long term with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type, oh, na, na, na, na

I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work
Uh oh
Oh

You're so amazing
You took the time to figure me out
Thats why you take me
Way past the point of turning me on

You 'bout to break me
I swear you got me losing my mind

Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?

Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
Oh, na, na, what's my name?
What's my name? what's my name?

Hey, boy, I really wanna see
If you can go long term with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type, oh, na, na, na, na

I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work
Uh oh
Oh

Hey, boy, I really wanna see
If you can go long term with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type, oh, na, na, na, na

I need a boy to take it over
Looking for a guy to put in work
Uh oh
Oh
