Well, you must be a girl with shoes like that
She said, "You know me well"
I'll see you and little Steven and Joanna
'Round the back of my hotel, oh yeah

Someone said you was asking after me
But I know you best as a blagger
I said, "Tell me your name, is it sweet?"
She said, "My boy it's Dagger," oh yeah

I was good, she was hot stealin' everything she got
I was bold, she was over the worst of it
Gave me gear, thank you dear, bring your sister over here
Let her dance with me just for the hell of it

Well, you must be a boy with bones like that
She said, "You got me wrong"
I would've sold them to you if I could've
Just to keep the last of my clothes on, oh yeah

Call me up, take me down with you when you go
I could be your regular belle
And I'll still dance for little Steven and Joanna
'Round the back of my hotel, oh yeah

I was good, she was hot stealin' everything she got
I was bold, she was over the worst of it
Gave me gear, thank you dear, bring your sister over here
Let her dance with me just for the hell of it

Chelsea, Chelsea, I believe that
When you're dancing slowly sucking your sleeve
The boys get lonely after you leave
It's one for the Dagger and another for the one you believe

Chelsea, I believe
When you're dancing slowly sucking your sleeve
The boys get lonely after you leave
It's one for the Dagger, another for the one you believe
One you believe, oh, no, no, no, no
