Tracy Jacks works in civil service
Tracy Jacks it's steady employment
Tracy Jacks it's a golfing fanatic
Tracy Jacks but his butt is erratic

Tracy Jacks saw a Harley street doctor
Tracy Jacks who prescribed healthy living
Tracy Jacks but he's getting past forty
Tracy Jacks and all the seams are splitting

Everyday he got closer
He knew in his heart he was over
I'd love to stay here and be normal
But it's just so overrated

Tracy Jacks left home without warning
Tracy Jacks at five in the morning
Tracy Jacks got on the first train to Walton
Tracy Jacks and stood on the seafront

Tracy Jacks threw his clothes in the water
Tracy Jacks and ran around naked
Tracy Jacks got stopped by the police
Tracy Jacks and escorted back home

Well, everyday he got closer
He knew in his heart he was over
I'd love to stay here and be normal
But then it's just so overrated

Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks

And then it happened
On a Tuesday morning
Tracy Jacks bulldozed down the house he lived in
Saying it's just so overrated

Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks
Tracy Jacks

Everyday he go closer
He knew in his heart he was over
I'd love to stay here and be normal
But it was always overrated
