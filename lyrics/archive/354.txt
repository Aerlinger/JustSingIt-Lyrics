Sent from heaven
Sent from heaven

Now you can wait your whole life wonderin'
When it's gonna come or where it's been
You may have got your heart broken
A few times in the past

Never last as strong as it used to
It don't feel as good as it used to before
And all the things you used to say
Things you used to do went right out the door

Ooh, no more will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?

When your love won't let you walk away
And you can't help who you love
And you find yourself givin' it all away
When you think you're in love, ooh 'cuz

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from, sent from heaven
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from, sent from heaven

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from, sent from heaven
And there's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from, sent from heaven

Now you can wait your whole life tryna change
What they feel from what's been
You may have put your whole life into a man
Lovin' what you thought it could've been

Don't wanna swing a change
When you don't feel as good as you used to before
And everything you used to say
Everything you used to do cleared right out the door

Ooh, no more will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before
What more can you say?

When your love won't let you walk away
And it can't help who it loves
And you find yourself givin' it all away
When you think you're in love 'cuz I wanna be

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from, sent from heaven
There's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from, sent from heaven

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from, sent from heaven
There's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from, sent from heaven

Everybody say I wanna be the one you love
I wanna be sent from heaven
Everybody say I wanna be the one you trust
I wanna be sent from heaven

Everybody say I wanna be the one you need
I wanna be sent from heaven
Everybody say I wanna be the one, oh
I wanna be the one sent from heaven

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from, sent from heaven
There's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from, sent from heaven

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from, sent from heaven
There's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from, sent from heaven

I wanna be the one who you believe
In your heart is sent from, sent from heaven
There's a piece of me who leaves when you're gone
Because you're sent from, sent from heaven

I wanna be the one
