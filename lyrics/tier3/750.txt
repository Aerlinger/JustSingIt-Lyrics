Oh, Johnny wishes he was famous
Spends his time alone in the basement
With Lennon and Cobain and a guitar and a stereo

And while he wishes he could escape this
But it all seems so contagious
Not to be yourself and faceless
In a song that has no soul

I remember feelin' low
I remember losin' hope
And I remember all the feelin's
And the day they stopped

We are, we are all innocent
We are all innocent
We are, we are

We are, we are all innocent
We are all innocent
We are, we are

Oh, Tina's losin' faith in what she knows
Hates her music, hates all of her clothes
Thinks of surgery and a new nose
Every calorie is a war

And while she wishes she was a dancer
And that she's never heard of cancer
She wishes God would give her some answers
And make her feel beautiful

I remember feelin' low
I remember losin' hope
And I remember all the feelin's
And the day they stopped

We are, we are all innocent
We are all innocent
We are, we are

We are, we are all innocent
We are all innocent
We are, we are

One day, you'll have to let it go
You'll have to let it go, no
One day, you'll stand up on your own
You'll stand up on your own, yeah

Remember losin' hope
Remember feelin' low
Remember all the feelin's
And the day they stopped

We are, we are all innocent
We are all innocent
We are, we are

We are, we are all innocent
We are all innocent
We are, we are

We are, we are all innocent
(One day, you'll have to let it go)
We are all innocent
(You'll have to let it go)
We are, we are
(No)

We are, we are all innocent
(One day, you'll stand up on your own)
We are all innocent
(You'll stand up on your own)
We are, we are
We are, we are all innocent
