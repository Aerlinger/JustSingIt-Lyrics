I thought you knew,
I had to stay away from you
I thought you heard,
Yeah still that you have the power
You cant be here
How long do you disappear
Dont wanna be the last one here
But you give me the sweet talk
And it works for me
And its the sweet words, that pulls me in
I know Im the weak one, and I wont say no
You give me a reason, so I never go

Dont keep me with the kisses,
Theres never any there when i need
Its just that you can always make me feel like I am slipping in way too deep
And let the shadows hope to hide the break of dreaming, of dreaming of us
And if I kee slipping in, just keep up with the talking
Know know that Im with you, Im not about to go

But you give me the sweet talk
And it works for me
And its the sweet words that pulls me in
I know Im the weak one, and I wont say no
You give me a reason, so I never go

So many moments we waste
Too many heartbeats away
So many moments we waste
Too many heartbeats away

But you give me the
But you give me the
But you give me the
But you give me the

But you give me the sweet talk
And it works for me
And its the sweet words that pulls me in
I know Im the weak one, and I wont say no
You give me a reason, so I never go

Give me the sweet talk
And it works for me
And its the sweet words that pulls me in
I know Im the weak one, and I wont say no
You give me a reason, so I never go
Sweet talk
Give me the sweet talk
