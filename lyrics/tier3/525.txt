Yeah, uh huh
La da da da da da
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry

Hey, baby my nose is getting big
I noticed it be growing when I been telling them fibs
Now you say your trust's getting weaker
Probably coz my lies just started getting deeper

And the reason for my confession is that I learn my lesson
And I really think you ought to know the truth
Because I lied and I cheated and I lied a little more
But after I did it I don't know what I did it for

I admit that I have been a little immature
F****** with your heart like I was the predator
In my book of lies I was the editor
And the author, I forged my signature

And now I apologize for what I did to ya
'Cos what you did to me I did to you

No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
No, no, no, no, yeah, you know, know
Know, know, you gotta try
What you gonna do when it all comes out?
When I really see you, what you're all about?

No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
Cause you know, you know, you know
You know, you know you gotta try

She said, I'm leaving, cos she can't take the pain
It's hard to continue this love, it ain't the same
Can't forget the things that I've done inside her brain
Too many lies committed, too many games

She feeling like a fool getting on the last train
Trying to maintain but the feeling won't change
I'm sorry for the things that I've done and what I became
Caught up in living my life in the fast lane

Blinded by lights, cameras, you know the fame
I don't know the reason why I did these things

And I lie and I lie and I lie and I lie
And now our emotions are drained
'Cos I lie and I lie and a little lie lie
And now your emotions are drained

No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
(No, don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah, you know, know, know, you gotta try
(Got to try, got to try)
What you gonna do when it all comes out?
(What you gonna do baby?)
When I really see you and what you're all about?

No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
Because you know, you know, you know
You know, you know you gotta try

Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo
Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo
Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo
Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo

Ooh hoo ooo ooo, ooh hoo ooo
(Ba da, ba da, ba ba ba ba, badada badada badada badada)
Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo
Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo
(Ba da, ba da, ba ba ba ba, badada badada badada badada)
Ooh hoo ooo hoo, ooh hoo ooo

Yo, I'm lying to my girl, even though I love her
And she all in my world
I give her all my attention and diamonds and pearls
She the one who makes me feel on top of the world
Still I'm lying to my girl, I do it

And I lie and I lie and I lie and
I lie till there's no turning back
I don't know why
(And I lie and I lie till I don't know who I am)

Then I tell myself
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
(Don't you lie)
No, no, no, no, yeah, you know, know,
Know, know you gotta try
(You know, you know you gotta)

What you gonna do when it all comes out?
When I really see you, what you're all about?
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no don't lie
No, no, no, no baby, no, no, no, no
Stop, stop stop, stop, stop stop
Stop lying
