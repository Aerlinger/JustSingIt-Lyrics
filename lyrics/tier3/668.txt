I feel like I've been locked up tight
For a century of lonely nights
Waiting for someone to release me

You're licking your lips and blowing kisses my way
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away
Baby, baby, baby
(Baby, baby, baby)

My body is saying let's go
But my heart is saying no

If you wanna be with me, baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way
If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression, I gotta like what you do

I'm a genie in a bottle baby, you gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby, come, come, come on and let me out

The music's fading and the lights down low
Just one more dance and then were good to go
Waiting for someone who needs me

Hormones racing at the speed of light
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight
Baby, baby, baby
(Baby, baby, baby)

My body is saying let's go
But my heart is saying no
(But my heart is saying no)

If you wanna be with me, baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way
(I'm a genie in a bottle)
If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true
(Wish come true)
Just come and set me free baby and I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle baby, you gotta rub me the right way honey
I'm a genie in a bottle baby, come, come, come on and let me out

I'm a genie in a bottle baby, you gotta rub me the right way honey
(If you wanna be with me)
I'm a genie in a bottle baby, come, come, come on and let me out

My body is saying let's go
But my heart is saying no, no

If you wanna be with me, baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way
(I'm a genie in a bottle)
If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true
You gotta make a big impression, I gotta like what you do

If you wanna be with me, baby there's a price to pay
I'm a genie in a bottle, you gotta rub me the right way
(You gotta rub me the right way)
If you wanna be with me, I can make your wish come true
Just come and set me free baby and I'll be with you

I'm a genie in a bottle baby, come, come, come, on and let me out
