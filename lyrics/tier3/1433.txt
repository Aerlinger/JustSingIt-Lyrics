I was born to laugh
I learned to laugh through my tears
I was born to love
I'm gonna learn to love without fear

Pour me a glass of wine
Talk deep into the night
Who knows, what we'll find

Intuition, deja vu
The Holy Ghost haunting you
Whatever you got, I don't mind

I was born to laugh
I learned to laugh through my tears
I was born to love
I'm gonna learn to love without fear

Put your elbows on the table
I'll listen long as I am able
There's nowhere I'd rather be

Secret fears, the supernatural
Thank God for this new laughter
Thank God the joke's on me

'Cause I was born to laugh
I learned to laugh through my tears
And I was born to love
I'm gonna learn to love without fear

We've seen the landfill rainbow
We've seen the junkyard of love
Baby, it's no place for you and me

I was born to laugh
I learned to laugh through my tears
And I was born to love
I'm gonna learn to love without fear

I was born to laugh
I learned to laugh through my tears
And I was born to love
I'm gonna learn to love without fear

I was born to laugh
I learned to laugh through my tears
And I was born to love
I'm gonna learn to love without fear

I was born to love
I'm gonna learn to love without fear
