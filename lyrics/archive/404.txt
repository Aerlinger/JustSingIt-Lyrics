Damn, I mean, I just keep thinkin' about you
I mean, I wanna move on but I cant move on
Its like you got some kinda hold on me and, man I dont know
But I'ma go ahead and talk about it, listen

I'm sittin' lookin' out the window like damn
Tryna fix this situation that's at hand
You're still runnin' through my mind
When I'm knowin' that you shouldn't be
Me all on your mind and I'm knowin' that it couldn't be

'Cause you ain't called and I ain't even appalled
I still got a lotta pain, I ain't dealt wit it all
I been runnin' 'round with other chicks, I'm single and they lovin' it
I'm likin' it but I just want the one that I was in love with

That's not the end of it, I'm tryna let you go
I can't get a grip of it is what I'm tryna let you know
You got a hold or some kinda control of me
I don't know what it is but I gotta get you gone from me

Im workin' at it and it ain't gettin' no better
Just tryna be like, yeah, forget it, whatever
Instead of starin' out this glass, lookin' at this bad weather
Damn, I gotta pull myself together 'cause

When Im with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When Im all alone, thats all I wanna do
I miss the smilin' faces in my Sidekick, outta town visits
All the time we spent together
Makes it hard to get you outta my system

And you know what you do to me, do to me
You dont even understand, damn
And you know what you do to me, do to me
Its so hard to get you outta my system

Im too attached, my heart wont let me fall back
I got it bad, thats what you can call that
And when I see you in the streets, thats the worse for me
Used to love the little things you did, thats what works for me

Its too major, dont see you in my pager
Know what you doin', where you at or can I see you later?
The fellas tellin' me, Just let her go, Bow
Believe me, Im tryin', man, I just dont know how

I be in all the top spots, leavin' with the hot shots
Knowin' they just want me 'cause Im in the top spot
Thats not poppin' and my brain ain't stoppin'
Thinkin' who she with or where she goin', is she club hoppin'?

I never had this kind of problem in my life
This is my first time dealin' with this kind of fight
Its every night and every flight and every time you in my sight
Damn, this ain't even right 'cause

When Im with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When Im all alone, thats all I wanna do
I miss the smilin' faces in my Sidekick, outta town visits
All the time we spent together
Makes it hard to get you outta my system

And you know what you do to me, do to me
You dont even understand, damn
And you know what you do to me, do to me
Its so hard to get you outta my system

Is it wrong for me to feel this way?
You been runnin' through my mind all day, can you feel me?
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time, thats what kills me

Is it wrong for me to feel this way?
You been runnin' through my mind all day, can you feel me?
I been tryna get you off my mind
But I can't after all this time and it kills me

When Im with somebody, all I think 'bout is you
When Im all alone, thats all I wanna do
I miss the smilin' faces in my Sidekick, outta town visits
All the time we spent together
Makes it hard to get you outta my system

And you know what you do to me, do to me
You dont even understand, damn
And you know what you do to me, do to me
Its so hard to get you outta my system

I remember everything that me and you talked about
Me and you had our whole life planned out together
And if I could, I would turn back the hands of time
And correct all my mistakes that I ever did

But now I guess I gotta move on, right?
Its still hard and I still love you to this day
Peace
