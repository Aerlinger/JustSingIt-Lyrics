You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
You aint nothin but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you aint no friend of mine

When they said, you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, they said, you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, you ain't never caught a rabbit
And you aint no friend of mine

You aint nothin but a hound dog
Cryin all the time
You aint nothin but a hound dog
Cryin all the time
Well, you aint never caught a rabbit
And you aint no friend of mine

When they said, you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Yeah, they said, you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Well, you aint never caught a rabbit
And you aint no friend of mine

When they said, you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
You know, they said, you was high classed
Well, that was just a lie
Well, you aint never caught a rabbit
And you aint no friend of mine

You aint nothin but a hound dog
Cryin all the time
You aint nothin but a hound dog
Cryin all the time
Well, you aint never caught a rabbit
You aint no friend of mine
