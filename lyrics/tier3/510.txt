[Intro - Akon & Baby Bash]
Hoooo
Yeah
Said everything that you want me to I'll do it
Tell me what the word is already [x4]

[Chorus - Akon]
Don't look no farther!
Baby im back (yeah)
I'm here to care to you (any thing that you want me: do ill do it)
Cause Ill be your lover (ill be your lover)
Ill be your best friend
Tell me what I gotta do (tell me what I gotta do and ill do it)

[Baby Bash]
Now im back in a flesh
Feelin so blessed, back in your corner suga, suga don't stress
Forget about the rest; let's go inside, im back in your zone
Baby im back in your vibe, now I cant be denied I can lie im on ya
I never ever wanna say sayonara
Some body told me that the grass was greener
On the other side of lake Arriba
Never really used to be a mean to cheat her
What I gotta do to be a keeper
These words comin out the speaker, true love is off the meter

[Chorus]

[Baby Bash]
I was gone for a minute but now im home,
Please forgive me for being a rolling stone,
Please forgive me let me polish it up like chrome,
Get off the phone till he swears to leave me alone,
Let my start your interest, now there's no more dating on the internet,
Cause you already know how I get it wet, how I get it so saucy and I get respect,
You don't have to look no farther, you dealin with the whole enchilada
You don't have to look no farther, you hotter then a fire starter

[Chorus]

[Baby Bash]
I was gone for a minute, (oooohhh) [repeat x4]
Now im back let me hit it (oooohhh) [repeat x4]

[Chorus x2]
