Stand on up and take a bow
There's something there and it's showin'
There's no need to look around
You're the best we got goin'

Shout out to the dreams you'll chase
Shout out to the hearts you'll break
Nothing's gonna stop you now
I guess you'd better be goin'

You'll never be far
I'm keeping you near
Inside of my heart
You're here

Go on
It's gotta be time
You're starting to shine
'Cause what you've got is

Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old, I know, you're gold
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I know, I know
I don't need the stars in the night
I've found my treasure
All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old, I know, you're gold
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I know, you're gold

It wont take long to get
When you feel like you're soarin'
So write it all and don't forget
You gotta tell us your story

Shout out to the friends back home
Shout out to the hearts you've known
You gave them nothing but the best
Yea, and you can tell them your story

You'll never be far
I'm keeping you near
Inside of my heart
You're here

Go on
It's gotta be time
You're starting to shine
'Cause what you've got is

Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old, I know, you're gold
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I know, I know
I don't need the stars in the night
I've found my treasure
All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old, I know, you're gold
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I know, you're gold

'Cause what you've got is
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old, I know, you're gold
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I know, I know
I don't need the stars in the night
I've found my treasure
All I need is you by my side
So shine forever
Go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-old, I know, you're gold
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh I know, you're gold

You're gold...
You're gold...
