[Verse 1]
When the sun goes down, down, down, down
Boy you're afraid of the dark, dark
And when the lights go out, out, out, out
Tell me do you know where to start, start
And when the bass gets loud loud loud
That is when I feel apart, -part
And when the world sleeps sound sound sound sound
..the sound is the key of my heart heart
[Chorus:]
we run, yes, we run the night, the night
we run, yes, we run the night,the night
we run, yes, we run the night, we we we run
We .. yes, as we run the night, the night. Ni-ni-ni-ni-night.
Run em like, run em, run em
Run em like, run em, run em
[Verse 2]
From the bottom of the Map, Miami,
To the land down Under, Austrailia,
You feel my drive, see my vision and hear my hunger
As my money gets older let's get younger
They sell their soul but the Devil knows I have no number
I'm Go Go baby, Fresh Oh baby, Go Go Baby, Uh oh baby, no no baby
Yeah yeah baby, now jiggle it baby, let me tickle it baby,
I know I'm lost it's gon be hard to save me,
I'm sorry that's how Dade county Raised me,
Yall heard me right we run the night now F*** You Pay Me!

Chorus:
We Run Yes uh We run the night night night
We Run Yes uh We run the night night night
We Run Yes uh We run the night ni-ni-ni-night

[Verse 3]
Feelin like a rush rush rush
Rushing past me all over my skin
I can get enough nough nough
'cause the beat keep pullin' me in
Taking me so high up up up
A place that I've never been ahh
Party party all night night night sleep all day then do it again.
[Chorus:]
We run, yes, we run the night, the night
Run em like run'em run'em
We run, yes, we run the night, night , night
We run, yes, we run the night, we we we run
We .. as we run the night, the night.
Run em like, run em , run em
Run em like, run em, run em
