I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
Swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothing but faith in nothing

Want to put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

I burn, burn like a wicker cabinet, chalk white and, oh-so frail
I see our time has gotten stale
The tick-tock of the clock is painful, all sane and logical
I want to tear it off the wall

I hear words in clips and phrases, I think sick like ginger ale
My stomach turns and I exhale

I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothing but faith in nothing

Want to put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

SoCal is where my mind states, but it's not my state of mind
I'm not as ugly, sad as you
Or am I origami? Folded up and just pretend
Demented as the motives in your head

I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothing but faith in nothing

Want to put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through with you

I alone am the one you don't know you need
Take heed, feed your ego
Make me blind when your eyes close
Sink when you get close, tie me to the bedpost

I alone am the one you don't know you need
You don't know you need me
Make me blind when your eyes close
Tie me to the bed post

I would swallow my pride, I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
Swallow my doubt, turn it inside out
Find nothing but faith in nothing

Want to put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin around to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous, then I'm through
Now I'm through with you

Through with you
Rendezvous then I'm through with you
