Like his dad you know that he's had
Animal nitrate in mind
Oh, in your council home he jumped on your bones
Now you're taking it time after time

Oh, it turns you on, on
Now he has gone
Oh, what turns you on, on
Now your animal's gone

Well he said he'd show you his bed
And the delights of his chemical smile
So in your broken home he broke all your bones
Now you're taking it time after time

Oh, it turns you on, on
Now he has gone
Oh, what turns you on, on
Now your animal's gone

What does it take to turn you on, on
Now he has gone
Now you're over 21
Now your animal's gone

Animal, he was animal, an animal
Animal, he was animal, an animal
Animal, animal, he's just an animal, an animal

Animal he was animal, he's just an animal
Animal, he was animal, he's just an animal
Animal, he was animal, he's just an animal

Songwriters
Butler, Bernard / Anderson, Brett
