[:chorus:]
Little things i should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me
Tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
And give me
Give me one more chance to keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

[:chorus:]
Little things i should have said and done
I just never took the time
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
