What you gon' do with all that junk?
All that junk inside your trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump

My hump my hump, my hump my hump my hump
My hump my hump, my hump, my lovely little lumps
Check it out

I drive these brothers crazy
I do it on the daily
They treat me really nicely
They buy me all these ICEEs

Dolce &Gabbana
Fendi and Adonna
Karen, they be sharin'
All their money got me wearin'

Fly gear but I ain't askin'
They say they love my ass n
Se7en Jeans, True Religion
I say no, but they keep givin'

So I keep on takin'
And no I ain't taken
We can keep on datin'
I keep on demonstrating

My love, my love my love my love
You love my lady lumps
My hump my hump my hump
My humps they got you

She's got me spendin'
(Oh)
Spendin' all your money on me
And spendin' time on me
She's got me spendin'
(Oh)
Spendin' all your money on me, on me, on me

What you gon' do with all that junk?
All that junk inside that trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump

What you gon' do with all that ass?
All that ass inside them jeans?
I'm a make, make, make, make you scream
Make you scream, make you scream

'Cos of my hump, my hump my hump my hump
My hump my hump my hump, my lovely lady lumps
Check it out

I met a girl down at the disco
She said, Hey, hey, hey yea let's go
I could be your baby, you can be my honey
And let's spend time, not money

I mix your milk wit my cocoa puff
Milky, milky cocoa
Mix your milk with my cocoa puff, milky, milky right

They say I'm really sexy
The boys they wanna sex me
They always standing next to me
Always dancing next to me

Tryin' a feel my hump, hump
Lookin' at my lump, lump
You can look but you can't touch it
If you touch it I'ma start some drama

You don't want no drama
No, no drama, no no no no drama
So don't pull on my hand boy
You ain't my man, boy
I'm just tryn'a dance boy
And move my hump

My hump, my hump my hump my hump
My hump my hump my hump
My hump my hump my hump

My lovely lady lumps
My lovely lady lumps
My lovely lady lumps
In the back and in the front
My lovin' got you

She's got me spendin'
(Oh)
Spendin' all your money on me
And spendin' time on me
She's got me spendin'
(Oh)
Spendin' all your money on me, on me, on me

What you gon' do with all that junk?
All that junk inside that trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off my hump

What you gon' do with all that ass?
All that ass inside them jeans?
I'm a make, make, make, make you scream
Make you scream, make you scream

What you gon' do with all that junk?
All that junk inside that trunk?
I'ma get, get, get, get you drunk
Get you love drunk off this hump

What you gon' do wit all that breast?
All that breast inside that shirt?
I'ma make, make, make, make you work
Make you work, work, make you work

She's got me spendin'

Spendin' all your money on me
And spendin' time on me
She's got me spendin'
(Oh)
Spendin' all your money on me, on me, on me
