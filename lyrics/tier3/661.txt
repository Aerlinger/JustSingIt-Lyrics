Hurray for a child that makes it through
If there's any way because the answer lies in you
They're laid to rest before they've known just what to do
Their souls are lost because

They could never find

What's this life for? What's this life for?
What's this life for? What's this life for?

I see your soul, it's kind of gray
You see my heart, you look away
You see my wrist, I know your pain
I know your purpose on your plane
Don't say a last prayer because

You could never find

What's this life for? What's this life for?
What's this life for? What's this life for?

But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle the score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of one king

But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of just as you know of one king, one king, one king

But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of just as you know of one king, one king, one king

But they ain't here anymore
Don't have to settle no goddamn score
'Cause we all live under the reign
Of one king
