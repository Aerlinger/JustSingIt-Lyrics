I like her long haired thick red bone
Open up her legs then filet mignon that pussy
I'ma get in and own that pussy, if she let me in I'ma own that pussy
Gon' throw it back and bust it open like you 'posed to
Girl I got that dope dick, now come here let me dope you

You gon' be a dope fiend, your friends should call you dopey
Tell 'em keep my name out they mouth if they don't know me
Huh, but you can't come until she, I'll fuck the whole groupie
Baby, I'm a groupie, my sex game is stupid, my head is the dumbest
I promise I should be hooked on phonics, yeah

But anyway I think you're bionic
And I don't think you're beautiful, I think you're beyond it
And I just wanna get behind it and watch you
(Back it up and dump it back, back it up and dump it back)

'Cause we like her, and we like her too
(Hey!)
We like her, and we like her too
(Hey!)
We like her, and we like her too
(Hey!)
We like her, and she like us too

And girl, I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world

Yeah, alright
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
She be jumpin' up and down tryin'a fit that ass in
Took her half an hour just to get that belt to fasten
All they want to talk about is partyin' and fashion
Every single night I have a dream that I am smashin' them all

Young Money, man this shit so timeless
And I'm in the mood to get faded, so please bring your finest
And what are all your names again? We drunk, remind us
Are any y'all into girls like I am? Let's be honest

She wants me, she wants me
'Cause I got it all, shawty, tell me what you don't see
I will fuck with all y'all, all y'all are beautiful
I just can't pick one so you can never say I'm choosy, hoes

And Wayne say pussy, pussy, pussy
And weed and alcohol seem to satisfy us all, damn
And every time I think of stayin' with her
She bring that friend around that make a nigga reconsider, man

'Cause we like her, and we like her too
(Hey!)
We like her, and we like her too
(Hey!)
We like her, and we like her too
(Hey!)
We like her, and she like us too

I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I-I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish, I wish I could fuck every girl in the world

I ain't being disrespectful baby I'm just being Millz
And I don't know how fake feels so I gotta keep it real
I just wanna fuck every girl in the world

Every model, every singer, every actress, every diva
Every House of Diddy chick, every college girl, every skeezer
Stripper and every desperate housewife that resemble Eva
My role model was Will, so married women and milf
It don't matter who you is, miss, you can get the business, ha

These hoes is god's gift like Christmas
I like 'em caramel skin, long hair thick ass
And I swear I'm feelin' all y'all, I'm scrollin' down my call log
And I'ma call all y'all

My butter pecan Puerto Rican
She screamin' out "papi" every time a nigga deep in
And I'm about to get my Bill Clinton on
And Hillary can Rodham too, boy, I gets my pimpin' on

'Cause we like her, and we like her too
(Hey!)
We like her, and we like her too
(Hey!)
We like her, and we like her too
(Hey!)
We like her, and she like us too

And oh, I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I-I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I-I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
(Hey!)
I-I wish, I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
(Hey!)
I-I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
(Hey!)

And bitch I'm Mack Maine -aine -aine -aine, and I like Meagan Good
Angelina Jolie, hah, D. Woods
For free suites, I'd give Paris Hilton all nighters
In about 3 years, holla at me Miley Cyrus

I don't discriminate, no not at all
Kit Kat a midget if that ass soft, I break her off
I exchange V cards with the retards
And get behind the Christian like Dee are 'cause he are
Mack Mizzo, baby, 'cause he are Mack Mizzo, baby

And I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
I wish I could fuck every girl in the world
(I wish I could fuck every girl in the world)
Young Money, baby
