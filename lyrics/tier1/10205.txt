I was twenty and she was eighteen
We were just about
As wild as we were green
In the ways of the world

She picked me up in that red rag top
We were free of the folks
And hidin' from the cops
On a summer night
Runnin' all the red lights

We parked way out
In a clearin' in a grove
And the night was as hot
As a coal burnin' stove
We were cookin' the gas
Ooh, it had to last

In the back of that red rag top
She said, please don't stop

Well, the very first time
Her mother met me
Her green eyed girl had then
A mother to be for two weeks

I was out of the job
And she was in school
And life was fast
And the world was cruel

We were young and wild
We decided not to have a child
So we did what we did
And we tried to forget

And we swore up and down
There would be no regrets
In the morning light
But on the way home that night

On the back of that red rag top
She said, please don't stop lovin' me

We took one more trip around the sun
But it was all make believe in the end
No, I can't say where she is today
I can't remember who I was back then

Well you do what you do
And you pay for your sins
And there's no such thing
As what might've been
That's a waste of time

Drive you outta your mind
I was stopped at a red light
Just yesterday beside a young girl
In a Cabriolet and her eyes were green
And I was in an old scene

I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped lovin' me
I was back in that red rag top
On the day she stopped lovin' me
