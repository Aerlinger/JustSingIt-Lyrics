[Hook]
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

[Verse 1]
I done kept it real from the jump
Living at my mama's house we'd argue every month
Nigga, I was trying to get it on my own
Working all night, traffic on the way home
And my uncle calling me like "Where ya at?
I gave you the keys told ya bring it right back"
Nigga, I just think its funny how it goes
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show

[Hook]
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

[Verse 2]
Boys tell stories about the man
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry
I could turn your boy into the man
There ain't really much I hear poppin off without us
Nigga, we just want the credit where it's due
I'ma worry about me, give a fuck about you
Nigga, just as a reminder to myself
I wear every single chain, even when I'm in the house

[Hook]
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here

[Bridge]
No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stays the same I never changed it
No new niggas, nigga we don't feel that
Fuck a fake friend, where you real friends at?
We don't like to do too much explaining
Story stay the same through the money and the fame

[Hook]
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team here nigga
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now my whole team fucking here, nigga
Started from the bottom now we here
Started from the bottom now the whole team fucking here
