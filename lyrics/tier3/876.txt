When we were younger we thought
Everyone was on our side
Then we grew a little bit
And romanticized the time I saw
Flowers in your hair
It takes a boy to live
It takes a man to pretend he was there

So then we grew a little and knew a lot
And now we demonstrated it to the cops
And all the things we said
We were self-assured

Cause it's a long road to wisdom
But it's a short one
To being ignored

Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes ai yai yai
And be in my heart

So now I think that I could
Love you back
And I hope it's not too late cause you're so attractive
And the way you move
I won't close my eyes
It takes a man to live
It takes a woman to make him compromise

Be in my eyes
Be in my heart
Be in my eyes ai yai yai
And be in my heart
