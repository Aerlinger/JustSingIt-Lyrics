Uh huh, this my shit
All the girls stomp your feet like this

A few times Ive been around that track
So its not just gonna to happen like that
Because I aint no Hollaback Girl, I aint no Hollaback Girl
Ooh ooh, this my shit, this my shit

I heard that you were talking shit
And you didnt think that I would hear it

People hear you talking like that, getting everybody fired up
So Im ready to attack, gonna lead the pack
Gonna get a touchdown, gonna take you out
Thats right, put your pom-poms down, getting everybody fired up

A few times Ive been around that track
So its not just gonna to happen like that
Because I aint no Hollaback Girl, I aint no Hollaback Girl
Ooh ooh, this my shit, this my shit

So thats right dude, meet me at the bleachers
No principals, no student, teachers
All the boys want to be the winner
But there can only be one

So Im gonna fight, gonna give it my all
Gonna make you fall, gonna sock it to you
Thats right Im the last one standing
Another one bites the dust

A few times Ive been around that track
So its not just gonna to happen like that
Because I aint no Hollaback Girl, I aint no Hollaback Girl
Ooh ooh, this my shit, this my shit

Let me hear you say this shit is bananas, B A N A N A S
(This shit is bananas, B A N A N A S)

A few times Ive been around that track
So its not just gonna to happen like that
Because I aint no Hollaback Girl, I aint no Hollaback Girl
Ooh ooh, this my shit, this my shit
