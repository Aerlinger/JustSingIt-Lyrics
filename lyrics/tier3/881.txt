Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Your thoughts are so unholy
In the holiest of holes
Onward Christian soldiers
Filled with jive and mind control

The blood left on the dance floor
Running running red
The bullet that you asked for
Killing you to death
Unless you

Someone kill the DJ
Shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Shoot the fucking DJ

Someone kill the DJ
Shoot the fucking DJ
Voices in my head are saying
"Shoot that fucker down!"

We are the vultures
The dirtiest kind
The culture wars in your heart and your mind

Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Beer goggles left in the club
My pocket full of pills
Sodom and Gommorah
In the century of thrills

The blood left on the dance floor
Running running red
The bullet that you asked for
Killing you to death
Unless you

Someone kill the DJ
Shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Shoot the fucking DJ

Someone kill the DJ
Shoot the fucking DJ
Hold him underwater
'Till the motherfucker drowns

We are the vultures
The dirtiest kind
The culture wars in your heart and mind

Someone's gonna to get you boy
Shoot that fucker down

Someone kill the DJ
Shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Shoot the fucking DJ
(Walking after dark)

Shoot that fucker down!

Someone kill the DJ
Shoot the fucking DJ
Someone kill the DJ
Shoot the fucking DJ

Someone kill the DJ
Shoot the fucking DJ
Voices in my head are saying
"Shoot that fucker down!"
