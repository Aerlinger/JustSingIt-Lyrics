Move your body out on the floor
Put your troubles aside and start living
Anybody can let go
Throw away all your problems 'cause right now it's party time

Girl, don't feel outta place
'Cause I, I'm in love with this feelin' now
And I, I hope that this will last a while
We should make it last a while

You had a dream, so do we
Bring your bitches, bring 'em to me
Hold your glasses up, people everywhere
Now everybody put your hands in the air, say

Yeah, yeah, yeah, girl, I wanna
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I wanna see you tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, girl, I gotta
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I gotta, I gotta, I've gotta see you tonight

Oh, oh, oh, let me see your hands
Oh, oh, oh, tonight is the night

Just in the moment, can't believe
You're so beautiful, feels like I'm in a dream
Baby, we're going somewhere you've never been before
So take my hand and come with me

Girl, don't feel outta place
'Cause I, I'm in love with this feelin' now
And I, I hope that this will last a while
We should make it last a while

You like to drink, so do we
Get my bottles, bring 'em to me
Hold your glasses up, people everywhere
Now everybody put your hands in the air, say

Yeah, yeah, yeah, girl, I wanna
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I wanna see you tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, girl, I gotta
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I gotta, I gotta, I've gotta see you tonight

Oh, oh, oh, let me see your hands
Oh, oh, oh, tonight, tonight is the night

All the pretty young things at the party
Let me see your hands up
And if they mad and they don't wanna party
Tell them shut the fuck up

So, DJ, turn it loud
And watch me turn it up
Don't worry about it, we here to party
So jump, jump, jump, jump

Girl, I wanna, I wanna see ya tonight
Girl, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta see ya tonight

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I wanna see ya tonight
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tonight is the night
Tonight is the night
Tonight is the night
