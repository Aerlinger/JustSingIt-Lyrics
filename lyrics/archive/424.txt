What's happenin'? Hey, dis ya boy Lil Jon! BME Clik!
What's up 40? What's happenin'?
What's up Sean Paul? What's happenin'?
Hey, now ladies and gentlemen, it's about dat time
To turn this thang on out, now let me see everybody do this
Hey, let's go

Snap ya fingers, do ya step
You can do it all by yo self
Let me see you do it, ay
Let me see you do it, ay

Snap ya fingers, do ya step
You can do it all by yo self
Let me see you do it, ay
Let me see you do it, ay

Snap ya fingers and then rock wit it
Do it, do it, do it, do it, gon' drop wit it
Do a step wit it, put your hips wit it
All my ladies let me see ya put a twist wit it

You can't do it like me, I'm by myself
I do it so good, I don't need nobody else
What's happenin', what's up, got da purp fired up
What's happenin', what's up, got Patrone in my cup

I pop, I drank
I'm on Patrone and purp, I can't thank
I'm blowed, to tha go
Don't know how tha hell I'm gettin' home

Snap ya fingers, do ya step
You can do it all by yo self
Let me see you do it, ay
Let me see you do it, ay

Snap ya fingers, do ya step
You can do it all by yo self
Let me see you do it, ay
Let me see you do it, ay

Straight from da bay, posted in tha 'A'
'Bout to hit tha club, we been mobbin' all day
Drinkin' on some rossa, dyin' off Patrone
VIP style, strapped wit my chrome

Look around tha club, what do I see
Everybody rockin' side to side to tha beat
Snappin' they fingers, bouncin' to tha groove
All by they self, that's tha new move

Nigga where I'm from, we like to go dumm
I'm soakin' up tha game, I'm seein' how it's done
I ask shawty 'What they call it?', she said 'Tha Pool Palace
Straight from Bankhead', I said, 'You good at it'

Do what cha do, you and ya crew
They even got playa's and thugs doin' it too
The mo' that I drank, tha more it's lookin' smooth
I's nuthin' to a boss, I can do tha shit too

Snap ya fingers, do ya step
You can do it all by yo self
Let me see you do it, ay
Let me see you do it, ay

Snap ya fingers, do ya step
You can do it all by yo self
Let me see you do it, ay
Let me see you do it, ay

Chillin' in tha bip, yeah, we get crunk
Niggas poppin' bottles and these gettin' drunk
Rollin' up tha kush, put it in tha air
I'm throwin' up tha E's to let 'em know we in here, yeah

Brand new shoes, brand new tool
Pull out tha ol' school, 'cuz I'm feelin' real cool
Yeah, I'm from tha 'A', so I'm leanin' and rockin'
Snappin' my fingers, then reachin' for my glock

Reppin' my block straight from tha deck
When you snap ya fingers shawty, gotta jerk ya neck
Smokin' on tha best, we don't wit dat mess
I bet you can't do it, do it, do it like this

Yeah, I'm back to tha track, back to tha snap
1, 2, step, then you gotta lean back
Dis is how we do it in tha 'A town'
And if you ain't know this how it goes down

Snap ya fingers, do ya step
You can do it all by yo self
Let me see you do it, ay
Let me see you do it, ay

Snap ya fingers, do ya step
You can do it all by yo self
Let me see you do it, ay
Let me see you do it, ay
Hey, hey
