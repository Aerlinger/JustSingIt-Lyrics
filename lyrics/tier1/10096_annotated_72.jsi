39 Called you for the first time yesterday38 I finally found the missing part of me37 I felt so close but you were far away31 Left me without anything to say0 * 53 Now I'm speechless over the edge, and just breathless* 49 I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again39 Hopeless, head over heels in the moment* 54 I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again0 37 I can't get your smile out of my mind31 (I can't get you outta my mind)36 I think about your eyes all the time39 You're beautiful but you don't even try32 (You don't even, don't even try)31 Modesty is just so hard to find0 * 53 Now I'm speechless over the edge, and just breathless* 49 I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again39 Hopeless, head over heels in the moment* 54 I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again0 * 41 I kissed her for the first time yesterday36 Everything I wished that it would be30 Suddenly I forgot how to speak* 41 Hopeless, breathless, baby can't you see?7 Now I'm0 * 53 Now I'm speechless over the edge, and just breathless* 49 I never thought that I'd catch this lovebug again* 47 Now I'm hopeless, head over heels in the moment* 54 I never thought that I'd get hit by this lovebug again17 Oh!
