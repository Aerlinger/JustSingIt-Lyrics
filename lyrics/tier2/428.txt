She take my money when I'm in need
Yea she's a triflin' friend indeed
Oh she's a gold digger way over town
That digs on me

Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz

Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head

Cutie the bomb, met her at a beauty salon
With a baby Louis Vuitton under her underarm
She said I can tell you ROC, I can tell by ya charm
Far as girls you got a flock
I can tell by ya charm and ya arm

But I'm lookin' for the one
Have you seen her?
My psychic told me she have a ass like Serena
Trina, Jennifer Lopez, four kids
An I gotta take all they bad ass to showbiz

Ok, get yo' kids but then they got their friends
I pulled up in the Benz, they all got a pen
We all went to Den and then I had to pay
If you fuckin' with this girl then you betta be payed
You know why?

It take too much to touch her
From what I heard she got a baby by Busta
My best friend say she use to fuck wit Usher
I don't care what none of ya'll say I still love her

Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz

Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head

18 years, 18 years
She got one of yo' kids, got you for 18 years
I know somebody payin' child support for one of his kids
His baby momma's car and crib is bigger than his
You will see him on TV Any Given Sunday
Win the Superbowl and drive off in a Hyundai

She was spose' to buy ya shorty Tyco with ya money
She went to the doctor got lypo with ya money
She walkin' around lookin' like Micheal with ya money
Should of got that insured Geico for ya money

If you ain't no punk holla, "We want prenup"
"We want prenup!", yeaah
It's something that you need to have
'Cause when she leave yo' ass she gone leave with half
18 years, 18 years
And on her 18th birthday, he found out it wasn't his

Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz
Now I ain't sayin' she a gold digger
But she ain't messin' wit no broke niggaz

Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head

Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs
You don't want ya dude to smoke but he can't buy weed
You go out to eat and he can't pay, ya'll can't leave
There's dishes in the back, he gotta roll up his sleeves

But while ya'll washin' watch him
He gone make it into a Benz out of that Datsun
He got that ambition baby look at his eyes
This week he moppin' floors, next week it's the fries

So, stick by his side
I know this dude's ballin' but yea that's nice
And they gone keep callin' and tryin'
But you stay right girl
But when you get on he leave yo' ass for a white girl

Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head get down
Get down girl, go head
Let me hear that back
