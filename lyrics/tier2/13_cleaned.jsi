I've been thinkin' bout you all day baby
waitin' on that sun to go down
whatcha say I pick you up after work
slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town
I got a blanket and a fifth of comfort
a little something to knock off the edge
it's supposed to get a little cool tonight
looks like I'm gonna have to hold you tight...
yeah

Bout a mile off old mill road
to that spot nobody knows
we park the truck and we take off running
hurry up, girl I hear it coming
got a moon and a billion stars
the sound of steel and old box cars
the thought of you is driving me insane
come on baby lets go listen to the night train

Yeah I hope its gonna be a long one
and if were lucky its moving slow
wouldn't mind if it lasted all night
lying next to you on that hillside...
lets go

Bout a mile off old mill road
in that spot nobody knows
we park the truck and we take off running
hurry up girl, I hear it coming
got a moon and a billion stars
the sound of steel and old box cars
the thought of you is driving me insane
come on baby lets go listen to the night train

Let's go listen to the night train

Bout a mile off old mill road
in that spot nobody knows
we park the truck and we take off running
hurry up girl, I hear it coming
got a moon and a billion stars
the sound of steel and old box cars
the thought of you is driving me insane
come on baby lets go listen to the night train

Let's go listen to the night train
