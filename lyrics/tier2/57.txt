Baby, you don't have to keep
Looking through my phone
If something's going on
Girl you'd already know
We don't even say two words
Without a fight anymore
How did we get here
Baby, I gotta know

On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me
And I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here? Baby
I gotta know hey baby girl

I told you girl when you first met me
It's a crazy world

Baby, you don't have to keep looking through my phone
If something's going on, girl you'd already know
We don't even say two words without a fight anymore
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me and I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

'Cause I remember when you first give it up
As we began to first live it up
I'll steer it up, I'll gear it up
We'll get to love so don't tear it up
But now you ain't seeing clear enough
Girl, you look in my phone and staring up
You tell me you want to share it up
I tell you that we shared enough
I told you girl, when we first met,
It's a crazy world

Baby, you don't have to keep looking through my phone
If something's going on, girl you'd already know
We don't even say two words without a fight anymore
How did we get here? Baby, I gotta know

On the other side of love
You tell me you hate me
And I hate you more
On the other side of love
How did we get here?
Baby, I gotta know

Baby, you don't have to keep
Looking through my phone
If something's going on,
Girl you'd already know
