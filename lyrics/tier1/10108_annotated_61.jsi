* 57 Jack and Diane painted a picture of my life and my dreams* 47 Suddenly this crazy world made more sense to me* 57 Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along34 'Cause every time I hear that song0 * 44 An' I go back to a two toned short bed Chevy37 Drivin' my first love out to the levy33 Livin' life with no sense of time* 46 An' I go back to the feel of a fifty yard line38 A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine* 43 Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks0 27 Every time I hear that song20 I go back, I go back0 * 59 I used to rock all night long to, "Keep On Rockin' Me Baby"* 61 Frat parties, college bars, just tryin' to impress the ladies* 57 Well, I heard it today and I couldn't help but sing along34 'Cause every time I hear that song0 * 46 An' I go back to the smell of an old gym floor39 The taste of salt on the Carolina shore* 48 After graduation and drinkin' goodbye to friends* 45 And I go back to watchin' summer fade to fall35 Growin' up too fast and I do recall* 43 Wishin' time would stop right in its tracks0 27 Every time I hear that song20 I go back, I go back0 * 49 We all have a song that somehow stamped our lives34 Takes us to another place and time0 * 44 So I go back to a pew, preacher, and a choir38 Singin' 'bout God, brimstone, and fire* 44 And the smell of Sunday chicken after church* 47 And I go back to the loss of a real good friend* 41 And the sixteen summers I shared with him* 51 Now "Only The Good Die Young" stops me in my tracks0 27 Every time I hear that song20 I go back, I go back0 32 To the feel of a fifty yard line38 A blanket, a girl, some raspberry wine9 I go back11 (I go back)0 31 To watchin' summer fade to fall35 Growin' up too fast and I do recall9 I go back11 (I go back)0 33 To the loss of a real good friend* 41 And the sixteen summers I shared with him9 I go back11 (I go back)0 20 I go back, I go back0 11 Songwriters19 CHESNEY, KENNETH A.0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 57 Read more: Kenny Chesney - I Go Back Lyrics | MetroLyrics
