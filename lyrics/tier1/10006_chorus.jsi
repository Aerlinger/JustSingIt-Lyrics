[:chorus:]
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then i'll float on down the river
To a cajun hideaway

Drift away like tom sawyer
Ride a raft with ol' huck finn
Take a nap like rip van winkle
Daze dreamin' again

[:chorus:]
Oh, play me some mountain music
Like grandma and grandpa used to play
Then i'll float on down the river
To a cajun hideaway
