Slim Thug

You need to stop playing round
With all them clowns and the wangstas
Good girls gotta get down with the gangstas
Go head girl put some back and some neck up on it
While I stand up in the background and check up on it

Ooo boy you lookin' like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it?
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let him check up on it
Watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

If you got flaunt it, boy I know you want it
While I turn around you watch me check up on it
Ooo you watchin' me shake it, I see it in ya face
Ya can't take it, it's blazin', you rock me and amaze me

You can look at it, as long as you don't grab it
If you don't go braggin', I'ma let you have it
You think that I'm teasin', but I ain't got no reason
I'm sure that I can please ya, but first I gotta read you

Ooo boy you lookin' like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it?
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let him check up on it
Watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

Ooo boy you lookin' like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it?
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let im check up on it
Watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

I can tell you wanna taste it, but I'm gon' make you chase it
You got to be patient, I like my men patient
More patience, you'll take might, get you in more places
You can't be abrasive, has to know to pace it

If I let you get up on it, you gotta make a promise
That you gon' put it on me, like no one's put it on me
Don't bore me, just show me, all men talk but don't please
I can be a tease, but I really wanna please you

Ooo boy you lookin' like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it?
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let him check up on it
Watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

Ooo boy you lookin' like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it?
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let him check up on it
Watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

I'm checkin' on you boo, do what you do
And while dance I'ma glance at this beautiful view
I'm keep my hands in my pants, I need to glue em with glue
I'm in a trance all eyes on you and your crew

Me and my mans don't dance, but to feel y'all bump and grind
If won't hurt if you go an' try one time
They all hot, but let me see this one's mine
It's Slim Thug and DC outta H-town

Ooo boy you lookin' like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it?
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let him check up on it
Watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

Ooo boy you lookin' like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it?
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let him check up on it
Watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

Ooo boy you lookin' like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it?
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let him check up on it
Watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight

Ooo boy you lookin' like you like what you see
Won't you come over and check up on it?
I'ma let you work up on it
Ladies let him check up on it
Watch it while he check up on it
Dip it, pop it, twerk it, stop it, check on me tonight
