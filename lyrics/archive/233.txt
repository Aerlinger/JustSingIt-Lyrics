	<li><p>I should've known by the way you passed me by</p></li>
	<li><p>There was something in your eyes and it wasn't right</p></li>
	<li><p>I should've walked, but I never had the chance</p></li>
	<li><p>Everything got out of hand, and I let it slide</p></li>
	<li><p>Now I only have myself to blame</p></li>
	<li><p>For falling for your stupid games</p></li>
	<li><p>I wish my life could be the way</p></li>
	<li><p>It was before I saw your face</p></li>
	<li><p>You stole my happy, you made me cry</p></li>
	<li><p>Took the lonely, and took me for a ride</p></li>
	<li><p>And I wanna undo it</p></li>
	<li><p>You had my heart, now I want it back</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm starting to see everything you lack</p></li>
	<li><p>Boy you blew it, you put me through it</p></li>
	<li><p>I wanna undo it</p></li>
	<li><p>Na, na, na, na, na</p></li>
	<li><p>Na, na, na, na, na</p></li>
	<li><p>Na, na, na, na, na na</p></li>
	<li><p>Now your photos don't have a picture frame</p></li>
	<li><p>And I never say your name, and I never will</p></li>
	<li><p>And all your things, well, I threw them in the trash</p></li>
	<li><p>And I'm not even sad</p></li>
	<li><p>Now you only have yourself to blame</p></li>
	<li><p>For playing all those stupid games</p></li>
	<li><p>You're always going to be the same</p></li>
	<li><p>Oh no, you'll never change</p></li>
	<li><p>You stole my happy, you made me cry</p></li>
	<li><p>Took the lonely, and took me for a ride</p></li>
	<li><p>And I wanna undo it</p></li>
	<li><p>You had my heart, now I want it back</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm starting to see everything you lack</p></li>
	<li><p>Boy you blew it, you put me through it</p></li>
	<li><p>I wanna undo it</p></li>
	<li><p>Na, na, na, na, na</p></li>
	<li><p>Na, na, na, na, na</p></li>
	<li><p>Na, na, na, na, na na</p></li>
	<li><p>You want my future, you can't have it</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm still trying to erase you from my past</p></li>
	<li><p>I need you gone so fast</p></li>
	<li><p>You stole my happy, you made me cry</p></li>
	<li><p>Took the lonely, and took me for a ride</p></li>
	<li><p>And I wanna undo it</p></li>
	<li><p>You had my heart, now I want it back</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm starting to see everything you lack</p></li>
	<li><p>Boy you blew it, you put me through it</p></li>
	<li><p>I wanna undo it</p></li>
	<li><p>You stole my happy, you made me cry</p></li>
	<li><p>Took the lonely, and took me for a ride</p></li>
	<li><p>Boy you blew it, you put me through it</p></li>
	<li><p>I wanna undo it</p></li>
