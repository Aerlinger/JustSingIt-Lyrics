Well its gold and green kerosene
Far beyond the glow of the city lights
You can feel it in the air
You can catch if you dare
And all you got to do is wait around
For you and I in the sleepy little town

Slow like a dream lost in memories
Locomotion hauls to a grind
I get lost in the blue of lazy afternoon
Bluer than my little boys eyes
For you and I in this sleepy little town

Sun keeps pouring in
With withered hands and leathered skin
Get up boy theres work to be done
Until the sun goes down on you and I
You and I in this sleepy little town
For you and I in this sleepy little town
