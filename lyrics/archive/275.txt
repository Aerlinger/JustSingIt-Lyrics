	<li><p>I've practiced this for hours, gone round and round</p></li>
	<li><p>And now I think that I've got it all down</p></li>
	<li><p>And as I say it louder, I love how it sounds</p></li>
	<li><p>‘Cause I'm not taking the easy way out</p></li>
	<li><p>Not wrapping this in ribbons</p></li>
	<li><p>Shouldn't have to give a reason why</p></li>
	<li><p>It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow</p></li>
	<li><p>I can't believe that I stayed ‘till today</p></li>
	<li><p>Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow</p></li>
	<li><p>But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise</p></li>
	<li><p>It came out like a river once I let it out</p></li>
	<li><p>When I thought that I wouldn't know how</p></li>
	<li><p>Held onto it forever just pushing it down</p></li>
	<li><p>Felt so good to let go of it now</p></li>
	<li><p>Not wrapping this in ribbons</p></li>
	<li><p>Shouldn't have to give a reason why</p></li>
	<li><p>It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow</p></li>
	<li><p>I can't believe that I stayed till today</p></li>
	<li><p>There's nothing here in this heart left to borrow</p></li>
	<li><p>There's nothing here in this soul left to say</p></li>
	<li><p>Don't be surprised when we hate this tomorrow</p></li>
	<li><p>God knows we tried to find an easier way</p></li>
	<li><p>Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow</p></li>
	<li><p>But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise</p></li>
	<li><p>Our favorite place we used to go</p></li>
	<li><p>The warm embrace that no one knows</p></li>
	<li><p>The loving look that's left your eyes</p></li>
	<li><p>That's why this comes as no, as no surprise</p></li>
	<li><p>If I could see the future and how this plays out</p></li>
	<li><p>I bet it's better than where we are now</p></li>
	<li><p>But after going through this</p></li>
	<li><p>It’s easier to see the reason why</p></li>
	<li><p>It's no surprise I won't be here tomorrow</p></li>
	<li><p>I can't believe that I stayed till today</p></li>
	<li><p>Yeah, you and I will be a tough act to follow</p></li>
	<li><p>But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise</p></li>
	<li><p>The kiss goodnight, it comes with me</p></li>
	<li><p>Both wrong and right, our memories</p></li>
	<li><p>The whispering before we sleep</p></li>
	<li><p>Just one more thing that you can't keep</p></li>
	<li><p>Our favourite place we used to go</p></li>
	<li><p>The warm embrace that no one knows</p></li>
	<li><p>The loving look that's left your eyes</p></li>
	<li><p>But I know in time we'll find this was no surprise</p></li>
