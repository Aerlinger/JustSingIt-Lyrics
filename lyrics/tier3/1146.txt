Dee, dee, na, na, na
Saturday night, I feel the air
Is getting hot like you baby
I'll make you mine you know

I'll take you to the top, I'll drive you crazy
Saturday night, dance, I like
The way you move, pretty baby
It's party time and not one
Minute we can lose, be my baby

Da, ba, da, dan, dee, dee, dee, da
Nee, na, na, na be my baby
Da, ba, da, dan, dee, dee, dee, da
Nee, na, na, na, pretty baby

Saturday night, I feel the air
Is getting hot like you baby
I'll make you mine you know

I'll take you to the top, I'll drive you crazy
Saturday night, dance, I like
The way you move, pretty baby
It's party time and not one
Minute we can lose, be my baby

Saturday night, dance, I like
The way you move, pretty baby
It's party time and not one
Minute we can lose, be my baby, ooh, ooh

Saturday, Saturday, Saturday night, Saturday night
De, dee, na, na, na
