Ive been in love with love and the idea of something binding us together. You know
that Love is strong enough.
And Ive seen time tell tales about that systematic drug. Well yea, that heart that
beats as one. Its collectively, unconsciously composed.
Do do do do..
Do do do do..
I lost my head in San Francisco, waiting for the fog to roll out, but I found it in a
raincloud. It was smiling down.
Do you feel the love?
I feel the love.
Come on, come on.
Lets start it up.
Let it pour out of your soul.
