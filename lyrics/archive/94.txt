	<li><p>Our love runs deep like a chevy</p></li>
	<li><p>If you fall I'll fall with you baby</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause that's the way we like to do it</p></li>

	<li><p>Cause that's the way you like to do it</p></li>
	<li><p>That's the way you like</p></li>
	<li><p>Just a little West Coast, and a bit of sunshine</p></li>
	<li><p>Hair blowing in the wind, losing track of time</p></li>
	<li><p>Just you and I, just you and I</p></li>
	<li><p>Woah, woah</p></li>

	<li><p>Cause that's the way I like to do it</p></li>
	<li><p>That's the way I like</p></li>
	<li><p>We touch down on the east coast</p></li>
	<li><p>Dinner in the sky rise, winter is the best time for walking in the city lights</p></li>
	<li><p>You and I, you and I</p></li>
