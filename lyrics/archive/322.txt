	<li><p>Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see</p></li>
	<li><p>That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be</p></li>
	<li><p>I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about</p></li>
	<li><p>And she's got everything that I have to live without</p></li>
	<li><p>Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny</p></li>
	<li><p>And I can't even see anyone when he's with me</p></li>
	<li><p>He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,</p></li>
	<li><p>I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night</p></li>
	<li><p>He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar</p></li>
	<li><p>The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star</p></li>
	<li><p>He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do</p></li>
	<li><p>Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?</p></li>
	<li><p>And there he goes, so perfectly,</p></li>
	<li><p>The kind of flawless I wish I could be</p></li>
	<li><p>She better hold him tight, give him all her love</p></li>
	<li><p>Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause</p></li>
	<li><p>He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar</p></li>
	<li><p>The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star</p></li>
	<li><p>He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do</p></li>
	<li><p>So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light</p></li>
	<li><p>I'll put his picture down and maybe</p></li>
	<li><p>Get some sleep tonight</p></li>
	<li><p>He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar</p></li>
	<li><p>The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart</p></li>
	<li><p>He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do</p></li>
	<li><p>He's the time taken up, but there's never enough</p></li>
	<li><p>And he's all that I need to fall into</p></li>
	<li><p>Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see</p></li>
