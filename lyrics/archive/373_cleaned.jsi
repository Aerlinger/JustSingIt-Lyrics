I'm gonna make it bend and break
(It sent you to me without wings)
Say a prayer, but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show
(Let the good times roll, let the good times roll)

And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?"
If that's the worst you've got better put your fingers back to the keys

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you only sweeter

One night yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the memories
See he tastes like you only sweeter

I'm looking forward to the future
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal ball

It's always cloudy except for, except for
When you look into the past, look into the past
One night stand
One night stand

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you only sweeter

One night yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the memories
See he tastes like you only sweeter

They say I only think in the form of
Crunching numbers in hotel rooms
Collecting page six lovers

Get me out of my mind
Gets you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from
Getting you into the mood

One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you only sweeter

One night yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the memories
See he tastes like you only sweeter

One night and one more time
(One more night, one more time)
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you only sweeter

One night yeah, and one more time
(One more night, one more time)
Thanks for the memories
Thanks for the memories
See he tastes like you only sweeter
