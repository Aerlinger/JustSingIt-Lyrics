You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And, with the word all my love came rushing out
And, every whisper it's the worst, emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow me now

[ CHORUS ]
So I put my faith in something unknown,
I've been living on such sweet nothing,
But Im trying to hope with nothing to hold,
I'm living on such sweet nothing.
And its hard to learn,
And its hard to love,
When youre giving me such sweet nothing,
Sweet nothing,
Sweet nothing,
Youre giving me such sweet nothing.

It isnt easy for me to let it go
Cause
I swallow every single word
And, every whisper, every sigh
eats away at this heart of mine.
And there is a hollow me now

[ CHORUS ]
So I put my faith in something unknown,
I've been living on such sweet nothing,
But Im trying to hope with nothing to hold,
I'm living on such sweet nothing.
And its hard to learn,
And its hard to love,
When youre giving me such sweet nothing,
Sweet nothing,
Sweet nothing,
Youre giving me such sweet nothing.

And it's not enough
To tell me that you care,
When
We both know the Words are empty air.
You Give Me Nothing!
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Nothing!
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet Nothing
Uoooh
Uoooh
Uoooh
Sweet Nothing
