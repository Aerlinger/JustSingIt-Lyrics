Smell your technicolor in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Treat you like the sound of lightning
Staring at the sun is blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky

Dress to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud

And it goes...

Wearing a psychotic red alert
You're a bouquet of flowers in the dirt
Radioactive primal
Nuclear is so delightful
Wear a decal when you know it hurts

Dress to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud

And it goes...

Smell your technicolor in your eyes
Makes me sick with pleasure in my mind
Treat you like the sound of lightning
Staring at the sun is blinding
Like a bottle rocket in the sky

Dress to the nines like a black cat's eyes
You're such a beautiful mess tonight
Wow that dirty dress is so loud
Wow that dirty dress is so loud

And it goes...
