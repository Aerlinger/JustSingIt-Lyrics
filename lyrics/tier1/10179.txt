Yo, I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want
So tell me what you want, what you really, really want
I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want
So tell me what you want, what you really, really want
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna really
Really, really wanna zigaziga

If you want my future, forget my past
If you wanna get with me, better make it fast
Now don't go wasting my precious time
Get your act together, we could be just fine

I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want
So tell me what you want, what you really, really want
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna really
Really, really, wanna zigazanga

If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get
With my friends
(Gotta get with my friends)
Make it last forever, friendship never ends

If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give
Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is

What do you think about that now you know how I feel
Say you can handle my love, are you for real?
I won't be hasty, I'll give you a try
If you really bug me, then I'll say goodbye

Yo, I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want
So tell me what you want, what you really, really want
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna really
Really, really wanna zigaziga

If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends
Make it last forever, friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give
Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is

So here's a story from A to Z, you wanna get with me
You gotta listen carefully
We got M in the place who likes it in your face
We got G like MC who likes it on an

Easy V doesn't come for free, she's a real lady
And as for me, haha you'll see
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around

If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends
Make it last forever friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give
Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is

If you wanna be my lover, you gotta, you gotta
You gotta
You gotta, you gotta, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp

Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down, zigazig ah

If you wanna be my lover
