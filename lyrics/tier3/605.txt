Maybe I don't really want to know
How your garden grows 'cos I just want to fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain as it soaks you to the bone

Maybe I just want to fly
I want to live I don't want to die
Maybe I just want to breath
Maybe I just don't believe

Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

I said maybe I don't really want to know
How your garden grows 'cos I just want to fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain as it soaks you to the bone

Maybe I will never be
All the things that I want to be
Now is not the time to cry
Nows the time to find out why

I think you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Maybe I don't really want to know
How your garden grows 'cos I just want to fly
Lately did you ever feel the pain
In the morning rain as it soaks you to the bone

Maybe I just want to fly
I want to live I don't want to die
Maybe I just want to breath
Maybe I just don't believe

Maybe you're the same as me
We see things they'll never see
You and I are gonna live forever

Gonna live forever, gonna live forever
We are gonna live forever
Gonna live forever, gonna live forever
We are gonna live forever
