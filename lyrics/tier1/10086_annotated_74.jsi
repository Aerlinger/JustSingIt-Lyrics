21 My life is brilliant.0 21 My life is brilliant.16 My love is pure.15 I saw an angel.17 Of that I'm sure.31 She smiled at me on the subway.25 She was with another man.34 But I won't lose no sleep on that,23 'Cause I've got a plan.0 35 You're beautiful. You're beautiful.28 You're beautiful, it's true.35 I saw your face in a crowded place,28 And I don't know what to do,30 'Cause I'll never be with you.0 23 Yes, she caught my eye,19 As we walked on by.38 She could see from my face that I was,* 44 Flying high. [ - video/radio edited version]26 @#$% high. [ - CD version]* 42 And I don't think that I'll see her again,* 51 But we shared a moment that will last 'til the end.0 35 You're beautiful. You're beautiful.28 You're beautiful, it's true.35 I saw your face in a crowded place,28 And I don't know what to do,30 'Cause I'll never be with you.0 35 You're beautiful. You're beautiful.28 You're beautiful, it's true.* 48 There must be an angel with a smile on her face,* 46 When she thought up that I should be with you.32 But it's time to face the truth,25 I will never be with you.0 0 11 Songwriters* 74 Amanda Gosein, James Blunt, Walter Afanasieff, Sacha Skarbek, Amanda Ghost0 12 Published by* 59 Lyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Ltd., David Platz Music
