Ooh, oh, let me tell you girl
Ohh, hey, here I go, here I go

I know you heard me sayin' time and time again
But they would rock your world and change your life
But I can't blame'em 'cuz you make a nigga
Wanna get involved, wanna get them drawls

Well I'm gon' put my bid in to get at you
No disrespect but I want it bad as they do
The only difference is they look out for themselves
But I'm doin' it just to hear you yell, yeah

O, that's gonna be the sound
Girl when it's goin' down your body's sayin'
O, don't have to say my name
Girl, I'm just glad you came so you can say

O, in the mornin', O, in the night
You sayin' O means O is hittin' it right
O, O, O, you can't get mad at me
I'm just aimin' to please, let me hear you scream O

Girl, come on over and let's get this thing crackin'
You'll be surprised when you see what O is packin'
'Cuz I'm young but I'm ready tryna get hot and heavy
Tell you girl if you let me in

Girl, I'ma take you somewhere that you never been
Show you some thing's that'll make you wanna show your friends
Have you so weak that you can't even say a thang but that's okay
All you gotta say

O, that's gonna be the sound
Girl when it's goin' down your body's sayin'
O, don't have to say my name
Girl, I'm just glad you came so you can say

O, in the mornin', O, in the night
You sayin' O means O is hittin' it right
O, O, O, you can't get mad at me
I'm just aimin' to please, let me hear you scream O

O is for that overtime I'm puttin' in
We'll go for hours, take a break and go at it again
Girl, I work my way from A all the way to Z
But just where baby girl O is where you wanna be

Now believe me when I tell you, I'm not tryna tell you what to do
'Cuz when it's said and done the choice ain't mine it's really up to you
Just say yes don't fix your mouth to tell me no
Drop that bottom jaw for and just say O

O, that's gonna be the sound
Girl when it's goin' down your body's sayin'
O, don't have to say my name
Girl, I'm just glad you came so you can say

O, in the mornin', O, in the night
You sayin' O means O is hittin' it right
O, O, O, you can't get mad at me
I'm just aimin' to please, let me hear you scream O

Let me hear you way O when I'm hittin' it
Let me hear you way O when I'm hittin' it
O, O, O, O, O
Let me hear you say O when it comes and go
Let me hear you say O from the back

Now somebody say my name
Let me hear you say O when the sun goes down
Let me hear you say O when you can't make another sound
Now scream, baby, girl let me hear you scream O
Baby, girl let me hear you scream O, O, O
Yeah, that's how you do it girl, just like that O, O
