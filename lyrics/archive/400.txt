Pretty Ricky, Ricky, Ricky
Pretty Ricky, Ricky, Ricky
Pretty Ricky, Ricky, Ricky
Pretty Ricky, Ricky, Ricky
Pretty Ricky, Ricky, Ricky

It's 5 in the mornin'
And I'm up talkin' dirty to you, you, more for me
And now I'm on the hotline
Over here lustin' for you, you, more for me

Let's talk about sex baby, let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about bubbles in the tub, let's talk about makin' love
Let's talk about cherries on top, girl it's goin' down
Said I wanna talk dirty to ya baby on the hotline

On the hotline, the sun ain't up but I had to call ya
'Cause I'm home alone lustin' for ya
I'm in my room, nothin' but a towel on
Take them granny panties off, put a thong on

I love it when I hear you moan
You got that sexy tone that turns ya boy on
You in a complete another city
On the fan line with nothin' but a baby tee on

You the kinda girl that's sexy in some boxer shorts
I'm the kinda player that make you ride it like a Porsche
Yeah, I met you on MySpace
Now I'm 'bout to fly you out to my place, in the mornin'

It's 5 in the mornin'
And I'm up talkin' dirty to you, you, more for me
And now I'm on the hotline
Over here lustin' for you, you, more for me

Let's talk about sex baby, let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about bubbles in the tub, let's talk about makin' love
Let's talk about cherries on top, girl it's goin' down
Said I wanna talk dirty to ya baby on the hotline

It's 5:30 in the mornin', good mornin', I'm yawnin', I'm yawnin'
I'm lonely, I'm lonely, I'm touchin' and rubbin'
Call me, call me my darlin', my darlin'
Called you 7 times, baby girl don't stall me

I wanna kiss you from your temple to your feet
To the dimples in your cheek, the tattoo or your belly ring
Conversation underneath the sheet
You know me, Redbull like a energy, I'm a freak

Girl you know I put it down like a vet
Say the sound of my deep voice make her sweat
You call me 5 am on the dot
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout you from the bottom to the top

Picture this, you say you comin' over
30 minutes later you was parkin' the Rover
Jumped out the car and I met you at the door
3 seconds in the house and you're beggin' me for more

Kiss you in your mouth and your hands on my cheeks
Straight action on the carpet, rug burns on my knees
Overdose on this love, scratch marks on my chest
Satisfy guarantee with the playboy spec

It's 5 in the mornin'
And I'm up talkin' dirty to you, you, more for me
And now I'm on the hotline
Over here lustin' for you, you, more for me

Let's talk about sex baby, let's talk about you and me
Let's talk about bubbles in the tub, let's talk about makin' love
Let's talk about cherries on top, girl it's goin' down
Said I wanna talk dirty to ya baby on the hotline

Pretty Ricky, Ricky, Ricky
Pretty Ricky, Ricky, Ricky
Pretty Ricky, Ricky, Ricky
Pretty Ricky, Ricky, Ricky
