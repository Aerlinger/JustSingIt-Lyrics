If we go down
We all go down together
If we go down, down, down
We all go down together

I'm backing you to the edge
Come on and follow
Come on and follow
Hang your soul by a thread
Through every tunnel
Though every tunnel
Take a dance with the dead
Put reality to bed
If your misery needs company
Call on me

If we go down
We all go down together
If we go down, down, down
We all go down together
We are one until it's right
Falling all as one tonight
If we go down, down, down
We all go down together

If we go down, down, down
If we go down, down, down
We all go down together

We've got nothing left to lose
Come on and shout it
Come on and shout it
And when the world is doomed
Get up and run it
Get up and run it
To the stars and back again
When we fall we're hand in hand
We're together like a symphony
Of broken dreams

If we go down
We all go down together
If we go down, down, down
We all go down together
We are one until it's right
Falling all as one tonight
If we go down, down, down
We all go down together

We are giants
We are bigger than a monster
Every second we are
Taking back the power
On the run till we get a fucking answer
Try to hold us down
But we're only getting stronger

If we go down, down, down
We all go down together
