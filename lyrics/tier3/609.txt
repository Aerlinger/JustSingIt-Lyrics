'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Try to make ends meet, you're a slave to money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet, yeah

No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold
But I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
[Have you ever been down]

Well I've never prayed, but tonight I'm on my knees, yeah
I need to hear some sounds that recognize the pain in me, yeah
I let the melody shine, let it cleanse my mind, I feel free now
But the airways are clean and there's nobody singing to me now

No change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
[Have you ever been down]
I can't change, I can't change

'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony, this life
Try to make ends meet, try to find some money then you die
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
You know the one that takes you to the places
Where all the veins meet, yeah

You know I can change, I can change, I can change, I can change
But I'm here in my mold, I am here in my mold
And I'm a million different people from one day to the next
I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no

I can't change my mold, no, no, no, no, no
I can't change my, no, no, no, no, no

It's such a sensual violence, melody violence
It's such a sensual violence, melody violence

I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down
I'll take you down the only road I've ever been down, been down
Ever been down, ever been down, ever been down, ever been down
Have you ever been down? Have you've ever been down?
Have you've ever been down?
