DJ Khaled!
Konvict Music
We the best!
We takin' over!
Listen!

I started in Atlanta then I spread out wit' it
South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi
On to North Carolina, Philadelphia and Virginia
From down in Miami where it warm in the winter

On up to Minnesota where it storm in the winter
Jackson then Tallahassee, Memphis, Tenn. holla at me
Been in H-Town, Southside, Cloverland daddy
I'm the man out in Dallas, better ask Khaled

Kept me out in Cali with my eyes open barely
Blowin' and spinnin', goin' down Bennett
Drop six-fo', three-wheel then switch it
Red light stop, make it drop for the bitches

Got a glock fo'-fifth, blow your head off wit' it
Anything you hear that I said, I meant it
King got the crown then sped off it wit' it
Say you need bricks, I said I get it

If you want to, we can supply you
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground

'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Listen!

Buzz is what I does
I get money ery day, ery day I does
That Benz is how I ride
Black flag on the left, two hoes

And right you better, move! AK all day
Get shot up like Shyne, that's on my niece
I'm B.I.G. like Diddy, damn it, I'm wit' it
Khaled we did it, Biggie in my city

Please no fitted, fuck it, I'm too pretty
Lean back and get brain, stupid, I'm silly
Money that come, runnin' like water
Mami so hot, damn it, she gorgeous

Miami on fire, you better be cautious
Might get shot on the porch of your fortress
Now they see it was no one from Port City
I run in here and Rick Ross is boss shit

'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Listen!

Blat, when you see Crack, better duck
Like the mac gotta ease past, nigga what?
Shit, I don't give fuck, I run these streets
Y'all talk that shit, I want that beef

I'ma tell you like a G told me
They'll come back quick if a nigga O.D.
Cash Rule Everything Around Me
I'm YSL, Versace

You could see me in that Porsche GT
Comin' down Sunset sittin' on D's
Feelin' like 'Pac, All Eyez On Me
Fresh bandana and I'm blowin' mad trees

Nigga please
I spit crack, every verse a ki
Some say Khaled, some say Colli
Twelve years down and I'm finally free, crack!

If you want to, we can supply you
Got enough work to feed the whole town
They won't shoot you unless you try to
Come around and try to stomp on our ground

'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Said we takin' over, one city at a time
Listen!

Birdman dead, and I'm number one
Nigga came at me wrong so we got him done
Fuckin' with the family I'ma give him somethin
Spent that co'ner, he didn't run

Sunday had a whole church singin' a song
"Why'd they have to send my baby home?"
Fuckin' with some niggas, that paper long
Been a G in the game now my son on the throne

I am the beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats
Im untamed, I need a leash
Im insane, I need a shrink

I love brain, I need a leech
Why complain on easy streets?
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak
And I like my Sprite Easter pink

And my wrist special par but the mule's cooler
I have more jewels than your jeweler
Touch and I will bust your medulla
That's a bullet hole, it is not a tumor

Red like red like stop your rumors
I stay on track like a box of Pumas
Now just r-r-rock with Junior
I am the little big Kahuna, ya dig?

'Cause we takin' over, one city at a time
