[:chorus:]
Oh no, we gonna rock down to electric avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Oh we gonna rock down to electric avenue
And then we'll take it higher

Workin' so hard like a soldier
Can't afford a thing on tv
Deep in my heart i am warrior
Can't get food for them kid

[:chorus:]
Good god, we gonna rock down to electric avenue
And then we'll take it higher
Oh we gonna rock down to electric avenue
And then we'll take it higher
