I need you, boo, I gotta see you, boo
And the hearts all over the world tonight
Said the hearts all over the world tonight
And I need you, boo, I gotta see you, boo
And the hearts all over the world tonight
Said the hearts all over the world tonight

Hey, little mama, ooh, you're a stunner
Hot little figure, yes, you a winner
And I'm so glad to be yours
You're a class all your own

And, ooh, little cutie, when you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops, you're my sweetheart
And I'm so glad that youre mine
You are one of a kind

And you mean to me what I mean to you
And together, baby, there is nothing we won't do
Cause if I got you I don't need money
I don't need cars, girl, you're my heart

And, oh, I'm into you
And, girl, no one else would do
Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love

And now I know I cant be the only one
I bet its hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life
Who feel what I feel when I'm

With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, girl
With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, oh girl

I don't want nobody else
Without you theres no one left and
You're like Jordans on Saturday
I gotta have you and I cannot wait now

Hey, little shorty, say you care for me
You know I care for you, you know that I'll be true
You know that I won't lie, you know that I will try
To be your everything, yeah

Cause if I got you I don't need money
I don't need cars, girl, you're my all

And, oh, I'm into you
And, girl, no one else would do
Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love

And now I know I cant be the only one
I bet its hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life
Who feel what I feel when I'm

With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, oh
With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, yeah

And I will never try to deny
That you are my whole life
Cause if you ever let me go I would die
So I won't front

I don't need another woman
I just need your all or nothing
Cause if I got that then I'll be straight
Baby, you're the best part of my day

I need you, boo, I gotta see you, boo
And the hearts all over the world tonight
Said the hearts all over the world tonight
They need they boo, they gotta see they boo
Said the hearts all over the world tonight
Hearts all over the world tonight

And, oh, I'm into you
And, girl, no one else would do
Cause with every kiss and every hug
You make me fall in love

And now I know I cant be the only one
I bet its hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life
Who feel what I feel when I'm

With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, girl
With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, oh

With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, with you
With you, with you, yeah
