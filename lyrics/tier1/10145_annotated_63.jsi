30 Come away with me in the night17 Come away with me27 And I will write you a song0 26 Come away with me on a bus35 Come away where they can't tempt us15 With their lies0 27 And I want to walk with you15 On a cloudy day* 48 In fields where the yellow grass grows knee-high25 So won't you try to come?0 32 Come away with me and we'll kiss16 On a mountaintop17 Come away with me30 And I'll never stop loving you0 35 And I want to wake up with the rain21 Falling on a tin roof33 While I'm safe there in your arms23 So all I ask is for you33 To come away with me in the night17 Come away with me0 11 Songwriters12 Jones, Norah0 12 Published by* 63 Lyrics Â© EMI Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group0 0 0 * 63 Read more: Norah Jones - Come Away With Me Lyrics | MetroLyrics
