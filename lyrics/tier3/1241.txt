La da da da dah
It's the motherfuckin' D O double G
La da da da dah
You know I'm mobbin' with the DRE
You know who's back up in this motherfucker
What what what what?
Blaze it up, blaze it up

Top dogg, bite me all, nigga burn the shit up
DPGC my nigga turn that shit up
CPT, LBC, yeah we hookin' back up
And when they bang this in the club baby you got to get up
Thug niggaz drug dealers yeah they givin' it up
Lowlife, yo' life, boy we livin' it up
Takin' chances while we dancin' in the party fo' sho'
Slip my hoe a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'

Bitches lookin' at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a swangin' my hair
Bitch quit talkin', crip walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet with some dick and take this dope from this jet
Out of town, put it down for the father of rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut yo' trap
Come back, get back, that's the part of success
If you believe in the X you'll be relievin' your stress

La da da da dah
It's the motherfuckin' DRE
La da da da dah
You know I'm mobbin' with the DO double G

Straight off the fuckin' streets of CPT
King of the beats you ride to 'em in your fleet
Or Coupe Deville rollin' on dubs
How you feelin' whoopty, whoop nigga whut?
Dre and Snoop chronic'ed out in the 'llac
With Doc in the back, sippin' on 'gnac
Clip in the strap, dippin' through hoods
Compton, Long Beach, Inglewood
South Central out to the Westside

It's California love, this California bud got a nigga gang of pub
I'm on one, I might bail up in the Century Club
With my jeans on, and my team strong
Get my drink on, and my smoke on
Then go home with, somethin' to poke on
Loc it's on for the two triple oh
Comin' real, it's the next episode

Hold up, hey
For my niggaz who be thinkin' we soft
We don't, play
We gon' rock it 'til the wheels fall off
Hold up, hey
For my niggaz who be actin' too bold
Take a, seat
Hope you ready for the next episode
Hey
Smoke weed everday
