(Chorus)
Slow down, grab the wall, wiggle
Like your tying to make yo ass fall off
(ass fall off)

Hella thick
I want to smash them all Now
Speed up
Gas pedal
Gas pedal [ x 5 ]
And You Already Know Me S.A.G.E

Look,Gas Pedal

Let them Boes Say Amen
I'm Just Try a Make It Clear
Boy Ray-Bans
I'm a great man woah
Say a friend
I Play a whole late night Dj Amen
Room full of boppers

Beat it,Beat it up no one hit the coppers
I'm S.A.G.E who would like to know

Fee-Fi fo-fum large me in yo throat
West-side baby do what you do
And you got tail, well that shit do
It's, pretty nigga mobbin it's the way that it go
I be steppin' up in the club they make 'em drop to my shoe
And you mad cause I spoon, but I don't give a fork
Silverware a nigga out if he actin' a poor spork
You's like boy grab a girl and get a yank-in'
Got a booty like coupes I'm tryna make-it, woah

(Chorus)

She a trick for a dolla bill
And her boyfriend a bitch call him Tyler Perry
Eugh, I'm in the black bat lookin' scary
On my way to the cake no bake-ary
Oops bakeries, never been no fake-amies
Lead her to the bathroom, she askin' where you takin' me
Uh, tell her slow down baby
I'm too turned up it's finna go down baby
When you hit the stage the people do a 180
When I hit the stage man the club wanna pay me
Uh, got a white bitch with me call that ho Slim Shady, uh
Nigga 'su so crazy
Got two hoes with me make my old bitch hate me, uh
All about my payment, you say we gettin' money that's an understatement uh

(Chorus)

Lil' mama got sex appeal
I make her sing if she wanna get a record deal
What the shit do, it's finna get real
She got a booty so big it's like a ferris wheel

Lil' mama got sex appeal
I make her sing if she wanna get a record deal
What the shit do, it's finna get real
She got a booty so big it's like a ferris wheel

(Chorus)
