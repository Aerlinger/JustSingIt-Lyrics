This one's for the lonely, the ones that seek and find
Only to be let down time after time
This one's for the torn down, the experts at the fall
Common friends get up now you're not alone at all

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

And this part was for her and this part was for her
This part was for her does, she remember?

It comes and goes in waves, I

This one's for the faithless, the ones that are surprised
They are only where they are now regardless of their fight
This one's for believing if only for it's sake
Common friends get up now love is to be made

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

And this part was for her and this part was for her
This part was for her, does she remember?

It comes and goes in waves, I
I am only let to wonder why
It comes and goes in waves, I
I'm only let to wonder why, why I try

This is for the ones who stand, for the ones who try again
For the ones who need a hand, for the ones who think they can

It comes and goes in waves, I
I am only let to wonder why?
It comes and goes in waves, I
I'm only let to wonder why, why I try

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
