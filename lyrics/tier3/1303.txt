L
Hope the wound heals but it never does
Thats cause you at war with love
You at war with love, yeah
G
These battle scars, dont look like theyre fading
Dont look like theyre ever going away
They aint never gonna change
These battle
L
Love
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruins ruin me
Arrow holes, they never close from cupid on a shooting spree
Feeling stupid cause I know it aint no you and me
But when youre trying to beat the odds up
and tryin to keep your nods up
you know that you should know
And let her go
But the fear of the unknown
Holding another lover strong
Sends you back into the zone
With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover not a fighter
On the frontline with a poem
Trying to write yourself a rifle
Maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks & drones of you being alone
G
I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much
Coz Im the only one thats trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you werent the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
Cause itll never be over,
it'll never be over
until you tell me its over
until you tell me it's over
These battle scars, dont look like theyre fading
Dont look like theyre ever going away
They aint never gonna change
These battle scars, dont look like theyre fading
Dont look like theyre ever going away
They aint never gonna change
These battle
L
Then just leave then
You shouldnt have but you said it
And I hope you never come back
It shouldnt have happened but you let it
Now youre down on the ground screaming medic
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armours and vests dont properly work
Thats why youre in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win
G
I wish I couldnt feel
I wish I couldnt love
I wish that I could stop cause it hurts so much
so much
And Im the only one thats trying to keep us together
When all of the signs say that I should forget her
I wish you werent the best, the best I ever had
I wish that the good outweighed the bad
Cause itll never be over,
can never be over
until you tell me its over
until you tell me it's over
These battle scars, dont look like theyre fading
Dont look like theyre ever going away
They aint ever gonna change
These battle scars, dont look like theyre fading
Dont look like theyre ever going away
They aint ever gonna change
These battle
Cause youve set me on fire fire
Ive never felt so alive, yeah
L
Now, hoping wounds heal, but it never does
Thats because youre at war with love
G
And Im at the point of breaking uh-huh
And its impossible to shake it
L
Yeah,
see
You hoped the wound heals, but it never does
Thats cause you at war with love
Hope it heals, but it never does
Thats cause you at war with love
G
These battle scars, dont look like theyre fading
Dont look like theyre ever going away
never
They aint ever gonna change
never
These battle scars, dont look like theyre fading
Dont look like theyre ever going away
never
They aint ever gonna change
never
These battle scars, dont look like theyre fading
Dont look like theyre ever going away
They ain't ever gonna change
These battle
