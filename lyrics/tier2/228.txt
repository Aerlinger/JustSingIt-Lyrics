Absolutely no one who knows me better
No one that can make me feel so good
How did we stay so long together?
Everybody, everybody said we never would

And just when I
Start to think they're right
The love has died

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it, do it one time?

There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue
You and me baby, we're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue
You and me baby, we're stuck like glue

Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days you know I wanna just give up

When it doesn't matter who's right
Fight about it all night
Had enough, you give me that look
I'm sorry baby let's make up

You do that thing that makes me laugh
And just like that

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it, do it one time?

There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue
You and me baby, we're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue
You and me baby, we're stuck like glue

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, you almost stay out
Two stuck together from the ATL out
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, feelin' kinda sick
Just a spoon full of sugar make it better real quick

I say, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whatcha gonna do with that?
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, come on over here with that
Sugar sticky sweet stuff, come and give me that stuff
Everybody want some

Melodies that get stuck up in your head
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, up in your head
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, up in your head
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, up in your head

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Stuck like glue
You and me together, say it's all I wanna do

I said there you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it, do it one time?

There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know I'm never letting this go

There you go making my heart beat again
Heart beat again, heart beat again
There you go making me feel like a kid
Won't you do it, do it one time?

There you go pulling me right back in
Right back in, right back in
And I know I'm never letting this go
I'm stuck on you

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue
You and me baby, we're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue
You and me baby, we're stuck like glue
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, stuck like glue
You and me baby, we're stuck like glue
