In my eyes, indisposed in disguise as no one knows
Hides the face, lies the snake and the sun in my disgrace
Boiling heat, summer stench, 'neath the black the sky looks dead
Call my name through the cream and I'll hear you scream again

Black hole sun, won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Stuttering, cold and damp, steal the warm wind tired friend
Times are gone for honest men and sometimes far too long for snakes
In my shoes, a walking sleep in my youth I pray to keep
Heaven send Hell away, no one sings like you anymore

Black hole sun, won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun, won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?

Hang my head, drown my fear
Till you all just disappear

Black hole sun, won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come?

Black hole sun, won't you come?
And wash away the rain
Black hole sun, won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?

Won't you come? Won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?
Won't you come? Won't you come?
