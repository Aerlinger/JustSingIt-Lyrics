* 302 [Hey Justin, this is your mother. I was just calling to see how you were doing; you sounded really up tight last night, made me a little nervous. I just wanna make sure you are really okay, and......[record scratch] see if you were checking in on your medications. You know I love ya! See ya. Bye bye.]0 * 60 I have to block out thoughts of you, so I don't lose my head* 55 They crawl in like a cockroach leaving babies in my bed* 58 Dropping little reels of tape, to remind me that I'm alone* 57 Playing movies in my head that make a @#$% feel like home* 61 There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain* 67 An ounce of peace is all I want for you, Will you never call again?* 66 And will you never say that you love me just to put it in my face?* 61 And will you never try to reach me, it is I that wanted space0 13 Hate me today16 Hate me tomorrow* 46 Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you15 Hate me in ways26 Yeah, ways hard to swallow* 49 Hate me so you can finally see whats good for you0 * 81 I'm sober now for 3 whole months, it's one accomplishment that you helped me with* 76 The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won't touch again* 70 In a sick way I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night* 73 While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight* 65 You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate* 62 You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take* 62 So I'll drive so @#$% far away that I'll never cross your mind* 57 And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind0 13 Hate me today16 Hate me tomorrow* 46 Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you* 42 Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow* 49 Hate me so you can finally see whats good for you0 * 46 And with a sad heart I say bye to you and wave* 63 Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made37 And like a baby boy I never was a man* 63 Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hands* 64 And then I fell down yelling "make it go away" just make a smile* 43 Come back and shine just like it used to be* 53 And then she whispered "How could you do this to me?"0 13 Hate me today16 Hate me tomorrow* 46 Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you* 42 Hate me in ways, yeah ways hard to swallow* 50 Hate me so you can finally see whats good for you.0 0 0 * 54 Read more: Blue October - Hate Me Lyrics | MetroLyrics
