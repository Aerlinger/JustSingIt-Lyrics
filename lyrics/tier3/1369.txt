If I only knew your name,
I'd go from door to door.
Searching on the crowded streets,
For the face that I once saw.

If I only knew your name,
I'd go from door to door.
Tell me have you seen the girl,
I met just once before?

One night of love,
Nothing more, nothing less.
One night of love,
to put my head in a mess.
Is that you on the bus?
Is that you on the train?
You wrote your number on my hand,
But it came off in the rain.

One night of love,
Nothing more, nothing less.
One night of love,
Has left my bed in a mess.
Is that you on the bus?
Is that you on the train?
You wrote your number on my hand,
But it came off in the rain.

If I only knew your name,
I'd go from door to door.
Searching on the crowded streets,
For the face that I once saw.

If I only knew your name,
I'd go from door to door.
Tell me have you seen the girl,
I met just once before?

Young love, it never seems to last,
Far too young, until they have a past.
Playing games, people move so fast,
You don't need eyes to see if someone's got a heart of glass.

Young love, it never seems to last,
Far too young, until they have a past.
One night of love,
Nothing more, nothing less.
One night of love,
Left my heart in a mess.

If I only knew your name,
I'd go from door to door.
Searching on the crowded streets,
For the face that I once saw.

If I only knew your name,
I'd go from door to door.
Tell me, have you seen the boy,
I met just once before?
