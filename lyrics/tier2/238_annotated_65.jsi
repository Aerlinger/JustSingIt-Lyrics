You are not me30 Who made you king of anything?30 So, you dare tell me who to be39 Who died and made you king of anything?0 21 You sound so innocent23 All full of good intent19 Swear you know best0 20 But you expect me to24 Jump up onboard with you36 Ride off into your delusional sunset0 26 I'm not the one who's lost21 With no direction, oh20 But you'll never see0 26 You're so busy making maps30 With my name on it in all caps27 You've got the talking down22 Just not the listening0 * 41 Who cares if you disagree? You are not me30 Who made you king of anything?29 So you dare tell me who to be39 Who died and made you king of anything?0 22 All my life I've tried* 50 To make everybody happy while I just hurt and hide* 43 Waiting for someone to tell me it's my turn9 To decide0 * 41 Who cares if you disagree? You are not me30 Who made you king of anything?29 So you dare tell me who to be39 Who died and made you king of anything?0 * 41 Who cares if you disagree? You are not me30 Who made you king of anything?29 So you dare tell me who to be39 Who died and made you king of anything?0 28 Let me hold your crown, babe0 11 Songwriters15 BAREILLES, SARA0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 65 Read more: Sara Bareilles - King Of Anything Lyrics | MetroLyrics
