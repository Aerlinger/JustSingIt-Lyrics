I fly with the stars in the skies
I am no longer tryin' to survive
I believe that life is a prize
But to live doesn't mean you're alive

Don't worry about me and who I fire
I get what I desire, it's my empire
And yes I call the shots, I am the umpire
I sprinkle holy water upon the vampire

In this very moment I'm king
In this very moment I slayed Goliath with a sling
This very moment I bring
Put it on everything, that I will retire with the ring

And I will retire with the crown, yes
No, I'm not lucky I'm blessed, yes
Clap for the heavyweight champ, me
But I couldn't do it all alone, we

Young Money raised me, grew up out in Baisley
Southside Jamaica, Queens and it's crazy
'Cause I'm still hood, Hollywood couldn't change me
Shout out to my haters, sorry that you couldn't faze me

Ain't being cocky, we just vindicated
Best believe that when we done this moment will be syndicated
I don't know, this night just remind me of
Everything they deprived me of

Put your drinks up
It's a celebration every time we link up
We done did everything they could think of
Greatness is what we on the brink of

I wish that I could have this moment 4 life
4 life, 4 life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive
Alive, alive

I wish that I could have this moment 4 life
4 life, 4 life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive
Alive, alive

What I tell 'em ho's bow, bow, bow to me, drop down to ya knees
Young Money the Mafia that's word to Lil Caes
I'm in the Dominican, Big Papi Ortiz
Doin' target practice, all these bitches just aimin' to please

Shout out to the CEO, five hundred degrees
Shout out to the OVO, Red Wings and fatigues, oh
Niggas wanna be friends, how coincidental
This supposed to be y'all year, we ain't get the memo

A young king, pay me in gold
Forty got a bunch of weed he ain't even rolled
These niggas be droppin' songs they ain't even cold
Weezy on top and that nigga ain't even home, yet

Yeah, be very afraid
These other rappers gettin' bodied and carried away
Fuck it, me and Nicki-Nick gettin' married today
And now you bitches that be hatin' can catch a bouquet, ooh

Yeah, you a star in my eyes
You and all them white girls, "Party of Five"
Are we drinkin' a lil' more I can hardly decide
I can't believe we really made it, I'm partly surprised, I swear

Damn, this one for the books, man
I swear this shit is as fun as it looks, man
I'm really tryin' to make it more than what it is
'Cause everybody dies but not everybody lives

I wish that I could have this moment 4 life
4 life, 4 life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive
Alive, alive

I wish that I could have this moment 4 life
4 life, 4 life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive
Alive, alive

This is my moment, I waited all my life
I can tell it's time
Driftin' away, I'm one with the sunset
I have become alive

I wish that I could have this moment 4 life
4 life, 4 life
'Cause in this moment, I just feel so alive
Alive, alive

I wish that I could have this moment 4 life
4 life, 4 life
This is my moment, I just feel so alive
Alive, alive

4 life
