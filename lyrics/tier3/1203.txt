[Intro: Big Sean (Kanye West)]
God, Oh God
Ive been working all god damn year
I just got my check
Im bout to spend it all on me
Im worth it, yup
Hold up, tell me what you see
Pull up, watch these motherfuckers freak
Say wuddup though when you see me in the streets
(GOOD Music in this bitch now drop that motherfuckin beat)

[Hook: Big Sean (Kanye West)]
Ok, this to all my enemies, that see me gettin guap right now
See me gettin guap right, see me gettin guap right now
This to all my hatin hoes, that see me gettin guap right now
See me gettin guap right now, hell yeah wont stop right now (Haaaa)
This to all my old hoes, that see me gettin guap right now
See me gettin guap right now, hell yeah wont stop right now (Yaaa)
See me gettin guap right now, hell na wont stop right now (Big Sean)
Hell na wont stop right now, see me gettin guap right now

[Verse 1]
Ok, I need 50k large
My momma needed a new crib
My daddy need a new car
So I be goin so hard
Detroit is my yard
I need a 17 car garage
I need a 17 bra manage
I need a jail house to free my dogs
I pay taxes, pay dues, pay bills my whole life
So Imma throw money in the air, like Im tryin to pay the sky
Told myself man if I cant live like this, Id rather die
I give it up to God, and he always replies
Control, your hoes, you let her talk to you crazy
You got baby mama drama, you aint even got you a baby
You foogazie, boss up, boss up with your time dog
You aint got time for no hoes, I aint even got time for time off

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Okay I need 50k large
My homie just beat the charge
My brother need a new job
So I be goin so hard
I need my face on a black car
My iPhone need the charge
My fish tank need sharks
I need a blimp to say the worlds ours
So these niggas can know
I do what they can
Im stuntin for all
The people who aint
You still hatin, you should be fucking ashamed
Far as I came, guess when youre in the game they want you to spring
Yeah, I know, but I dont get my stress on
Takin shots swear is like my stomachs made of teflon
They like boy wont you get your rest on
Bitch cuz Im up for every hour, I was slept on
The last time I dreamt about, two girls bisexual
They was tryin things, try-sexual
Then I woke up in a city, where the population match the death toll
Drew my blueprint, got it illustrated affiliated
Millions chasin go to sleep wake up continuated
Life of a Don, Sean Don, sippin never had a palm reader
Always had my palms itchin time to get it
Boy I was taught to get it till its gone
Even when I got it, watch me get it like I dont

[Hook]
yeaaa
[Outro]
Right Now, Woah, (x6)
Ok, this to all my enemies, that see me gettin guap right now
See me gettin guap right now, hell yeah wont stop rigth now
See me gettin guap right now, hell na wont stop right now
Hell na wont stop right now, see me gettin guap right now
