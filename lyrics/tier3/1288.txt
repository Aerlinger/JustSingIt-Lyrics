Well I woke up tonight and said I
I'm gonna make somebody love me
I'm gonna make somebody love me
And now I know, now I know, now I know
I know that it's you
You're lucky, lucky, you're so lucky!

Well do ya, do ya, do ya wanna?
Well do ya, do ya, do ya wanna?
Wanna go, where I've never let you before?

Well do ya, do ya, do ya wanna?
Well do ya, do ya, do ya wanna?
Want a go, of what I've never let you before?

Well he's a friend and he's so proud of you
He's a friend and I knew him before you, oh yeah
Well he's a friend and we're so proud of you
Your famous friend, well I blew him before ya, oh yeah

Well do ya, do ya, do ya wanna?
Well do ya, do ya, do ya wanna?
Wanna go, where I've never let you before?

Well here we are at the transmission party
I love your friends they're all so arty, oh yeah

Well I woke up tonight and said I
I'm gonna make somebody love me
I'm gonna make somebody love me
And now I know, now I know, now I know
I know that it's you
You're lucky lucky, you're so lucky!

Well do ya, do ya, do ya wanna?
Well do ya, do ya, do ya wanna?
Want a go, of what I've never let you before?

Lucky lucky, you're so lucky
Lucky lucky, you're so lucky
Lucky lucky, you're so lucky
Lucky lucky, you're so lucky

Lucky lucky, you're so lucky
Oh lucky lucky, you're so lucky
Yeah!
