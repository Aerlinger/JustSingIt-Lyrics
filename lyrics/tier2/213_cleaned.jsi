Ooh, I can't go any further than this
Ooh, I want you so badly, it's my biggest wish

Cool, I spend my time just thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' 'bout you
Every single day, yes I'm really missin', missin' you
And all those things we used to, used to, used to do
Hey girl, what's up? It used to, used to be just me and you

I spend my time just thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' 'bout you
Every single day, yes I'm really missin', missin' you
And all those things we used to, used to, used to do
Hey girl, what's up? Yo? What's up? What's up? What's up?

Can you meet me halfway, right at the borderline?
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be lookin' out night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I stay

Ooh, ooh, I can't go any further than this
Ooh, ooh, I want you so bad, it's my only wish

Girl, I travel 'round the world and even sail the seven seas
Across the universe, I go to other galaxies
Just tell me where to go, just tell me where you wanna meet
I navigate myself, myself to take me where you be

'Cause girl I want, I, I, I want you right now
I travel uptown, town, I travel downtown
Wanna to have you around, 'round like every single day
I love you alway-way, I'll meet you halfway

Can you meet me halfway, right at the borderline?
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be lookin' out night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I stay

Ooh, ooh, I can't go any further than this
Ooh, ooh, I want you so bad, it's my only wish
Ooh, ooh, I can't go any further than this
Ooh, ooh, I want you so bad, it's my only wish

Let's walk the bridge to the other side, just you and I
(Just you and I)
I will fly, fly the skies for you and I
(For you and I)

I will try until I die for you and I
For you and I, for, for, for you and I
For, for, for you and I, for, for you and I
(For you and I)

Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?

Meet me halfway, right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be lookin' out night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I stay

Ooh, ooh, I can't go any further than this
Ooh, ooh, I want you so bad, it's my only wish
Ooh, ooh, I can't go any further than this
Ooh, ooh, I want you so bad, it's my only wish
