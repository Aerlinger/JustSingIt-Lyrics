nYou'd beg if I was under your hood
But it ain't doing us any good
Rolling through town and going too slow
What we need is an open road

400 horses need a little room to run
Well if you ain't gonna do it let me show you how it's done

Drive it like it's stolen, park like it's rented
What's the point of money if you ain't gonna spend it?
There's a reason roads go past the city limits
Do you wanna drive? Come on, you can ride shotgun
Shotgun

Traffic jam as I'm sitting by, old man holding that same old sign
Tell me that the end is near but they've been saying that 100 years
But what if he's right, baby?
Maybe this time it's true
And we got nothing to lose

Drive it like it's stolen, park like it's rented
What's the point of money if you ain't gonna spend it?
There's a reason roads go past the city limits
Do you wanna drive? Then baby you can ride shotgun
Shotgun

We gotta drive it like it's stolen, park like it's rented
What good is your money if you ain't gonna spend it?
There's a reason roads go past the city limits
If you ain't gonna drive then baby come on, ride shotgun

Drive it like it's stolen, park like it's rented (Shotgun)
What's the point of money if you ain't gonna spend it?
There's a reason roads go past the city limits
If you ain't gonna drive then baby you can ride shotgun
Shotgun
Shotgun
