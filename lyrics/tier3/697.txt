She grew up with the children of the stars
In the Hollywood hills, in the Boulevard
Her parents threw big parties, everyone was there
They hung out with folks like Dennis Hopper
And Bog Seager, and Sunny and Cher

She feels safe now in this bar in Farfax
And from the stage I can tell that
She can't let go and she can't relax
And just before she hangs her head to cry
I sing to her a lullabye

I say, everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye, rockabye

She still lives with her mom outside the city
Down that street about a half a mile
And all her friends tell her she's so pretty
But she'd be whole lot prettier if she smiled once in a while
'Cause even her smile looks like a frown
She's seen her share of devils in this angel town

I say, everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye, rockabye

I told her, "I ain't so sure about this place
It's hard to play a gig in this town and keep a straight face
It seems like everybody with a plan
It's kinda like Nashville, with a tan"

I say, everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye, rockabye

I say, everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye
Everything's gonna be alright
Rockabye, rockabye, rockabye

Bye, bye
Bye, bye
