La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
You know, I've never felt like this before
Oh oh
La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
(This feeling's like so real)
Oh oh

I'm obsessive when just one thought of you comes up
And I'm aggressive, just one thought ain't close enough
You got me stressing, incessantly pressing the issue
Cause every moment gone you know I miss you

I'm the question and you're of course the answer
Just hold me close boy cause I'm your tiny dancer
You make me shaken, I'm, never mistaken
But I can't control myself, got me calling out for help

S-O-S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
I can't take it, see it don't feel right

S-O-S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossing and turning can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Just your presence and I second guess my sanity
Yes, it's a lesson, it's unfair, you stole my vanity
My tummy's up in knots and when I see ya it gets so hot
My common sense is out the door, can't seem to find the lock

S-O-S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossing and turning can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

Boy, you know you got me feeling open
And boy, your love's enough with words unspoken
I said boy! I'm telling you, you got me open
I don't know what to do, it's true
I'm going crazy over you, I'm begging

S-O-S, please someone help me
It's not healthy for me to feel this
Y-O-U are making this hard
You got me tossing and turning can't sleep at night

This time please someone come and rescue me
Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Love is testing me but still I'm losing it

This time please someone come and rescue me
'Cause you on my mind has got me losing it
I'm lost, you got me looking for the rest of me
Got the best of me, so now I'm losing it

La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
Oh oh
La la la, la la la, la la la la la, oh
Oh oh
