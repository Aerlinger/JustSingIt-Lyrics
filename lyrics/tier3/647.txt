Ooh
Here come the Men In Black
It's the MIB's, uh, here come the MIB's
Here come the Men In Black
(Men In Black)
They won't let you remember

Nah nah nah
The good guys dress in black, remember that
Just in case we ever face to face and make contact
The title held by me, MIB
Means what you think you saw, you did not see
So don't brink be what was there is now gone
The black suits with the black Ray Bans on

Walk in shadow, move in silence
Guard against extra-terrestrial violence
But yo we ain't on no government list
We straight don't exist, no names and no fingerprints
Saw somethin' strange, watch your back
(Ooh, ooh)
'Cause you never quite know where the MIB's is at
Uh, eh

Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black
Galaxy defenders
Oho oho oho
Here come the Men In Black, Men In Black
They won't let you remember
(Won't let you remember)

Aha, aha
Now, from the deepest of the darkest of night
On the horizon, bright light enters sight tight
Cameras zoom, on the impending doom
But then like boom black suits fill the room up
With the quickness, talk with the witnesses
Hypnotizer, neuralizer, vivid memories turn to fantasies
Ain't no MIB's, can I please?

Do what we say, that's they way we kick it
D'ya know what I mean
(Hmm, hmm)
I see my noisy cricket get wicked on ya
We're your first, last and only line of defense
Against the worst scum of the universe
So don't fear us, cheer us
If you ever get near us, don't jeer us, we're fearless
MIB's freezin' up all the flack
(What's that stand for?)
Men In Black

The Men In Black
(Uh, eh)
The Men In Black
(Uh, eh)

Let me see ya just bounce it with me
Just bounce with me
(Bounce with me)
Just bounce with me
Come on, let me see ya just slide with me
Just slide with me
(Slide, slide)
Just slide with me
(Slide, slide)

Come on, let me see ya talk a walk with me
Just walk with me
(Walk with me)
Take a walk with me
Come on and make your neck work
Now freeze

Ohh
Here come the Men In Black
(Men in black)
Galaxy defenders
(Ohh, ooohh)
Here come the Men In Black
(Men in black)
They won't let you remember
(Oh no)

Alright check it
Let me tell you this in closing
I know we might seem imposing
But trust me, if we ever show in your section
Believe me, it's for your own protection

'Cause we see things that you need not see
And we be places that you need not be
So go on with your life
Forget that Roswell crap
Show love to the black suit
'Cause that's the men in
That's the men in

Here come the Men In Black
(Here they come)
Galaxy defenders
(Galaxy defenders)
Here come the Men In Black
(Oho, here they come)
They won't let you remember
(Won't let you remember)

Here come the Men In Black
(Oh, here they come)
Galaxy defenders
(Oho oho oho)
Here come the Men In Black
They won't let you remember
