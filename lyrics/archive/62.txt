	<li><p>I didn't wanna be the one to forget</p></li>
	<li><p>I thought of everything I'd never regret</p></li>
	<li><p>A little time with you is all that I get</p></li>
	<li><p>That's all we need because it's all we can take</p></li>
	<li><p>One thing I never see the same when you're 'round</p></li>
	<li><p>I don't believe in him - his lips on the ground</p></li>
	<li><p>I wanna take you to that place on the "Roche"</p></li>
	<li><p>But no one gives us any time anymore</p></li>
	<li><p>He asked me once if I'd look in on his dog</p></li>
	<li><p>You made an offer for it then you ran off</p></li>
	<li><p>I got this picture of us kids in my head</p></li>
	<li><p>And all I hear is the last thing that you said</p></li>
	<li><p>"I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"</p></li>
	<li><p>I didn't want to anymore</p></li>
	<li><p>And we will never be alone again</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause it doesn't happen everyday</p></li>
	<li><p>Kinda counted on you being a friend</p></li>
	<li><p>Can I give it up or give it away?</p></li>
	<li><p>Now I thought about what I wanna say</p></li>
	<li><p>But I never really know where to go</p></li>
	<li><p>So I chained myself to a friend</p></li>
	<li><p>'Cause I know it unlocks like a door</p></li>
	<li><p>And we will never be alone again</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause it doesn't happen everyday</p></li>
	<li><p>Kinda counted on you being a friend</p></li>
	<li><p>Can I give it up or give it away?</p></li>

	<li><p>But I never really know where to go</p></li>
	<li><p>So I chained myself to a friend</p></li>
	<li><p>Still more again</p></li>
	<li><p>It didn't matter what they wanted to see</p></li>
	<li><p>He thought he saw someone that looked just like me</p></li>
	<li><p>The summer memory that just never dies</p></li>
	<li><p>We worked too long and hard to give it no time</p></li>
	<li><p>He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies</p></li>
	<li><p>Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise</p></li>
	<li><p>He runs the scissors at the seam in the wall</p></li>
	<li><p>He cannot break it down or else he would fall</p></li>
	<li><p>One thousand lonely stars hiding in the cold</p></li>
	<li><p>Take it, Oh I don't wanna sing anymore</p></li>
	<li><p>"I listened to your problems, now listen to mine"</p></li>
	<li><p>I didn't want to anymore</p></li>
	<li><p>And we will never be alone again</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause it doesn't happen everyday</p></li>

	<li><p>I don't understand, don't get upset, I'm not with you</p></li>
	<li><p>We're spinning around, it's all I do, when I'm with you</p></li>
	<li><p>And we will never be alone again</p></li>
