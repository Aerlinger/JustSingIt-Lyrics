When the sun goes down
On my side of town
That lonesome feelin'
Comes to my door
The whole world turns
Blue

There's a rundown bar
Across the railroad track
I gotta table for two
Way in back
Where I sit alone
And think of losin' you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of a neon moon

Now if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers
Are runnin' wild and free
I close my eyes
And sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke filled room

No tellin' how many tears
I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies
That I've lied
Tellin' my poor heart
She'll come back someday

Ohh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

Ohh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

The jukebox plays on
Drink by drink
And the words of every sad song
Seem to say what I think
And its hurt inside of me
Ain't never gonna end

Ohh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

Ohh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

An' watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

Ohh, watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
