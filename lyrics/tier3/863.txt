Come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love?

Take these arms that were made for lovin'
And this heart that will beat for two
Take these eyes that were meant for watching over you

And I've been such a long time waiting
For someone I can call my own
I've been chasing the life I'm dreaming, now I'm home

I need your love, like night needs morning
So won't you

So won't you come, come, come into my world?
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love?
Oh, baby, come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, higher upon your love

Take these lips that were made for kissing
And this heart that will see you through
And these hands that were made to touch and feel you

So free your love, hear me I'm calling
Oh baby

Oh won't you come, come, come into my world?
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love?
Oh, baby, come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, higher upon you love?

I need your love, like night needs morning
Oh baby

Oh won't you come, come, come into my world?
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love?
Oh baby, come, come, come into my world
Won't you lift me up, up, high upon your love?
