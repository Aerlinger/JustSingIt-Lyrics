Looking up from underneath,
Fractured moonlight on the sea.
Reflections still look the same to me,
As before I went under.

And it's peaceful in the deep,
Cathedral where you can not breathe,
No need to pray, no need to speak
Now I am under.

Oh, and it's breaking over me,
A thousand miles down to the sea bed,
I found the place to rest my head.

Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me,
And all this devotion was rushing out of me,
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me,
But the arms of the ocean deliver me.

Though the pressure's hard to take,
It's the only way I can escape,
It seems a heavy choice to make,
Now I am under.

And it's breaking over me,
A thousand miles down to the sea bed,
Found the place to rest my head.

Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.

And the arms of the ocean are carrying me,
And all this devotion was rushing out of me,
And the crushes are heaven for a sinner like me,
But the arms of the ocean delivered me.

And it's over,
And I'm goin' under,
But I'm not givin' up!
I'm just givin' in.

Woooah!
Slipping underneath.
Woooah!
So cold, but so sweet.

In the arms of the ocean, so sweet and so cold,
And all this devotion I never knew it all
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner released,
But the arms of the ocean delivered me.

Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.

Delivered me.

Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.

Delivered me.

Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.

Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.

And it's over,
And I'm goin' under,
But I'm not givin' up!
I'm just givin' in.

Woooah,
Slipping underneath.
Woooah,
So cold, but so sweet
