Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car, this charming man

Why pamper life's complexities
When the leather runs smooth
On the passenger seat ?

I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"

A jumped up pantry boy, who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

I would go out tonight
But I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome
That someone so handsome should care"
Na, na na, na na, na na, this charming man
Oh, na na, na na, na na, this charming man

Oh, a jumped up pantry boy, who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
