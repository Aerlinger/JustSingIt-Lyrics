I don't want you to know
I took it with me
But when things are thrown away like they are daily
Time passes in the constant state
So if that is how it is
I don't wanna be a star
But a stone on the shore
Long door, frame the wall
When everything's overgrown
But what she really really wanted was my rights in the rooms
And I wouldn't understand that I would try to play along
And I don't want you to know
I took it with me
But when things are thrown away like they are daily
Time passes in the constant state
So if that is how it is
I don't wanna be a star
But a stone on the shore
Long door, frame the wall
When everything's overgrown
But what she really really wanted was my rights in the rooms
And I wouldn't understand that I would try to play along
And I don't want you to know
I took it with me
But when things are thrown away like they are daily
Time passes in the constant state
So if that is how it is
I don't wanna be a star
But a stone on the shore
Long door, frame the wall
When everything's overgrown
[x2:]
But what she really really wanted was my rights in the rooms
And I wouldn't understand that I would try to play along
And I don't want you to know
I took it with me
But when things are thrown away like they are daily
Time passes in the constant state
Time passes in the constant state
Time passes in the constant state
Time passes in the constant state
