15 I close my eyes39 Only for a moment and the moment's gone13 All my dreams34 Pass before my eyes with curiosity0 16 Dust in the wind32 All they are is dust in the wind0 13 Same old song38 Just a drop of water in an endless sea9 All we do* 47 Crumbles to the ground, though we refuse to see0 10 (Aa aa aa)16 Dust in the wind30 All we are is dust in the wind10 Oh, ho, ho0 17 Now don't hang on* 43 Nothin' lasts forever but the earth and sky13 It slips away* 43 And all your money won't another minute buy0 16 Dust in the wind30 All we are is dust in the wind32 (All we are is dust in the wind)0 16 Dust in the wind32 (Everything is dust in the wind)30 Everything is dust in the wind13 (In the wind)0 5 (Ooo)5 (Ooo)5 (Ooo)0 11 Songwriters16 Livgren, Kerry A0 12 Published by* 63 Lyrics Â© EMI Music Publishing, Universal Music Publishing Group0 0 0 * 57 Read more: Kansas - Dust In The Wind Lyrics | MetroLyrics
