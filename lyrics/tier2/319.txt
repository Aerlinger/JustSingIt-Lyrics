Hey, this a special what's happenin' to all my
All my soldiers over there in Iraq
Everybody right here, what you need to do
Be thankful for the life you got, you know what I'm sayin'?
Stop lookin' at what you ain't got
Start bein' thankful for what you do got
Let's give it to 'em baby girl, hey

You're gonna be a shinin' star
In fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you'll see you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows just who you are

So live your life, hey
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life, oh
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life, hey
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life, oh
(Joss, we did it again homie)
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life
(Hey)
My life
(Oh)
My life
(Hey)
My life
(Oh)

Just livin' my life
(Hey)
My life
(Oh)
My life
(Hey)
My life
(Oh)
Just livin' my life

Hey, never mind what haters say
Ignore 'em 'til they fade away
Amazin' they ungrateful
After all the game I gave away

Safe to say I paved the way
For you cats to get paid today
You still be wastin' days away
Now had I never saved the day

Consider them my protg
Homage I think they should pay
Instead of bein' gracious
They violate in a major way

I never been a hater
Still I love 'em in a crazy way
Some say they sold the yay'
And know they couldn't get work on Labor Day

It ain't that black and white
It has an area the shade of gray
I'm Westside anyway
Even if I left today and stayed away

Some move away to make a way
Not move away 'cause they afraid
I brought back to the hood
And all you ever did was take away

I pray for patience but they
Make me wanna melt they face away
Like I once made 'em spray
Now I could make 'em put the K's away

Been thuggin' all my life
Can't say I don't deserve to take a break
You'd rather see me catch a case
And watch my future fade away

You're gonna be a shinin' star
In fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you'll see you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows just who you are

So live your life, hey
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life, oh
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life, hey
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life, oh
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life
(Hey)
My life
(Oh)
My life
(Hey)
My life
(Oh)

Just livin' my life
(Hey)
My life
(Oh)
My life
(Hey)
My life
(Oh)
Just livin' my life

I'm the opposite of moderate
Immaculately polished
With the spirit of a hustler
And the swagger of a college kid

Allergic to the counterfeit
Impartial to the politics
Articulate, but still will
Grab a nigga by the collar quick

Whoever havin' problems with
Their record sales just holla Tip
If that don't work and all else fails
Then turn around and follow Tip

I got love for the game
But hey, I'm not in love with all of it
Could do without the fame
And rappers nowadays are comedy

The hootin' and the hollerin'
Back and forth with the arguin'
Where you from? Who you know?
What you make? And what kind of car you in?

Seems as though you lost sight
Of what's important when depositin'
Them checks into your bank account
And you up out of poverty

Your values is a disarray, prioritizin' horribly
Unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss poor morally
Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin'
And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

You're gonna be a shinin' star
In fancy clothes and fancy cars
And then you'll see you're gonna go far
'Cause everyone knows just who you are

So live your life, hey
You steady chasin' that paper
Just live your life, oh
Ain't got no time for no haters

Just live your life, hey
No tellin' where it'll take ya
Just live your life, oh
'Cause I'm a paper chaser

Just livin' my life
(Hey)
My life
(Oh)
My life
(Hey)
My life
(Oh)

Just livin' my life
(Hey)
My life
(Oh)
My life
(Hey)
My life
(Oh)
Just livin' my life

Got everybody watchin' what I do, come walk in my shoes
And see the way I'm livin' if you really want to
Got my mind on my money
And I'm not goin' away

So keep on gettin' your paper and keep on climbin'
Look in the mirror and keep on shinin'
'Til the game ends, 'til the clock stop
We gonna post up on the top spot

Livin' the life, the life
In the Windmill City, got my whole team with me
The life, my life
I do it how I wanna do

I'm livin' my life, my life
I will never lose
I'm livin' my life, my life
And I'll never stop it

So live your life
