Verse 1
Dear Darlin', please excuse my writing.
I can't stop my hands from shaking cos I'm cold and alone tonight.
I miss you and nothing hurts like no you.
And no one understands what we went through.
It was short. It was sweet. We tried.

Pre Chorus 1
And if my words break through the wall and meet you at your door, all I
Could say is:
"Girl, I mean them all." yeah I do ooh

Chorus 1
Dear Darlin', please excuse my writing.
I can't stop my hands from shaking cos I'm cold and alone tonight.
I miss you and nothing hurts like no you.
And no one understands what we went through.
It was short. It was sweet.
We tried.

We tried.

Woman: I understand why we split before a month.

Verse 2
Been thinking about the bar we drank in.
Feeling like the sofa was sinking.
I was warm in the hope of your eyes.

Pre Chorus 2
So if my words break through the wall
to meet you at your door,
all I could say is:
"Girl, I mean them all."

Chorus 2
Dear Darlin', please excuse my writing.
I can't stop my hands from shaking cos I'm cold and alone tonight.
I miss you and nothing hurts like no you.
And no one understands what we went through.
It was short. It was sweet. We tried.

Oh I concur. These arms are yours to hold.

Chorus 3
And I miss you and nothing hurts like no you.
And no one understands what we went through.
It was short. It was sweet. We tried. We tried
