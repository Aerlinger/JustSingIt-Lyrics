That's What I Do
Yeah
Uh
Feelin kinda famous, yeah
That's What I Do

[Verse 1: Classified]
I'm feelin kinda famous in my hometown
People hold me up, cause I hold em down
I never moved away from my family
And got the same friends since elementary
You know the name and the style
But don't know what I have
Cause in my circle of friends,
The ones that posted and bragged
Ended up insecure
Jealous of what others had
Glad I got raised a little different by my mother and dad
You know what I mean?
I was a skater and a jock
Always showing off
My role-models were Wayne Gretzky and Tony Hawk
A C-student, I was average and best
Till I found hip hop and put my attitude to check
Then I found my identity, stopped caring about what anybody said to me
A lot of people make music to make you go forget about life
I make mine to hopefully help you out and deal with it right
That's what I do!

[Hook]
How many times I got to tell ya
I'm doin' this with or without cha
I went through all of it and back again
That's what I do, no need to ask again

[Verse 2]
And I ain't playing about the books, I don't know how
I write my own story as it goes down
And you can either love me or hate me
No one cares about the ones who play it safely
Even my manager party's more than I do
I usually leave the party by 2
Go get high and hit the drivethru
I feeling kinda old for this shit
But the kid inside of me don't know when to quit
Huh, I bring the weed to the party cause I'm courteous
I started burnin' it, cause I was curious
Now marihuana's my reality
But never touch a harder stuff cause my addictive personality
I know my limits, what I can and what I can't do
I understand myself so I don't underhand my health
And sheer determination and true grit face it
Don't follow any path, Blaze it.
That's what I do!

[Hook]
How many times I got to tell ya
I'm doin' this with or without cha
I went through all of it and back again
That's what I do, no need to ask again

[Verse 2]
Yeah and it's true
I think about this music every day and night
I'm just passionate about the way I write
But every now and then I need to take a break from this
Cause I can't even raise my kid or take a shit without attempting to create a hit
My lifestyle ain't changed since 19
And I'm still at the liquor store gettin' ID'd
With the same crew, Jay, Brew, Ivy
And might be us losin' touch?
Highly unlikely
Ask the wrong person, I'm a has been and done with
Ask the right person, I'm a legend who runs shit
You either gonna love this or dump this
But all I can do is keep it 100
That's what I did!

[Hook]
How many times I got to tell ya
I'm doin' this with or without cha
I went through all of it and back again
That's what I do, no need to ask again
