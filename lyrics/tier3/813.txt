Nah, we got a fucking Audi, that bitch all white
Pull up on your bitch, bet she gonna like

Fake shoes, that's that shit I don't like
Fake niggas, that's that shit I don't like
Stalking ass bitch, shit I don't like

But I will never snitch none in my life
I keep this shit 3Hunna I'm going right
With my niggas when it's time to start taking lives
Playing both sides, shit that I don't like
War time spark broad day, all night
Playing both sides, shit that I don't like
War time spark broad day, all night

A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like, nah
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like, nah

Broski got the 30 he ain't tryina fight
Got your bitch, I was hittin it all night
Fredo in the cut, that's a scary sight
You not with the Six, you can die tonight
I only want the top, I ain't tryina pipe
Them youngings with the shits, they be totin' pipe
Floating off a flat, I might take a flight
3Hunna bitch we hot, we done took flight
Taking shit down we ain't like the price
Thirsty ass bitches see that we don't like

A fuck nigga, that's that shit I don't like, nah
A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like, nah
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like, nah

A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like, nah
A bitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like, nah
Fake goons, that's that shit I don't like
Fake goons, that's that shit I don't like
Fake niggas, that's that shit I don't like
