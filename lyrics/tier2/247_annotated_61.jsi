* 44 I found God on the corner of 1st and Amistad30 Where the West was all but won37 All alone, smoking his last cigarette* 49 I said, "Where you been?" He said, "Ask anything"0 * 49 Where were you when everything was falling apart?* 55 All my days were spent by the telephone that never rang* 43 And all I needed was a call that never came32 To the corner of 1st and Amistad0 * 45 Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me* 41 Lying on the floor surrounded, surrounded* 55 Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?* 46 Just a little late, you found me, you found me0 37 But in the end everyone ends up alone* 41 Losing her, the only one who's ever known40 Who I am, who I'm not and who I wanna be* 46 No way to know how long she will be next to me0 * 45 Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me* 43 Lying on the floor surround me, surround me* 55 Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?* 47 Just a little late, you found me, you found me!0 34 The early morning, the city breaks* 61 And I've been calling for years and years and years and years33 And you never left me no messages28 You never sent me no letters* 45 You got some kind of nerve taking all I want!0 * 45 Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me* 51 Lying on the floor, where were you? Where were you?0 * 45 Lost and insecure, you found me, you found me* 41 Lying on the floor surrounded, surrounded* 55 Why'd you have to wait? Where were you? Where were you?* 47 Just a little late, you found me, you found me.0 * 46 Why'd you have to wait to find me, to find me?0 11 Songwriters27 King, Joseph / Slade, Isaac0 12 Published by29 Lyrics Â© EMI Music Publishing0 0 0 * 51 Read more: Fray - You Found Me Lyrics | MetroLyrics
