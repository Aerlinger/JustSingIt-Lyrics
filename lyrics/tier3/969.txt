Well some may say it's not even funny
And there you stand not even trying
They say it is in line with the angel
Sometimes noise is just your mind

But the lesson is vague in the light now
Shows a dear with her mind on the moor
And I'll something with the sun is just a friend
Since they shook the earth in 1904

And as I lowered down I hear it's a message
And its 1902 just telling people to get out
And if there was just a way I could tell them
It's been long but you are right

And the singing is slow and so quiet
Like the sound when you sleep off the floor
And I'll something with the dirt is just a friend
Since they shook the earth in 1904

And when the night is young with the bridge is sung
Something passing by I was sure
And the only one you can tell it to
Well it's the only one that ever knows

And since more robbers made to go through my window
Here is something so strange and something louder than before
And you living with no light or direction
But temper size and now you know

When believing is hard but you go now
And you feel what you drag across the floor
Because something with these drills are just a friend
Since they shook the earth in 1904

And when the night is young but the bridge is sung
Something passing by I was sure
And the only one you will tell it to
Well it's the only one who will ever know

And some will say it's not even healthy
But body is young and mind is sure
That something is alright well you're thinking
Cause they shook the earth in 1904
