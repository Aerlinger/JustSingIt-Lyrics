You know what
I like the playettes
No diggity, no doubt, uh
Play on playette
Play on playette
Yo Dre, drop the verse

It's going down, fade to Blackstreet
The homies got RB, collab' creations
Bump like Acne, no doubt
I put it down, never slouch
As long as my credit can vouch
A dog couldn't catch me straight up
Tell me who can stop when Dre making moves
Attracting honeys like a magnet
Giving 'em eargasms with my mellow accent
Still moving this flavour
With the homies Blackstreet and Teddy
The original rump shakers

Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly bitch, you don't play around
Cover much ground, got game by the pound
Getting paid is a forte
Each and every day, true player way
I can't get her out of my mind
(well)
I think about the girl all the time (well, well)

East side to the west side
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Fast when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in
Can I get down, so I can win

[Chorus: x4]
I like the way you make it
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

She's got class and style
Street knowledge by the pound,
Baby never act wild
Very low key on the profile
Catching feelings is a no,
Let me tell you how it goes
Herb's the word, spin's the verb
Lovers it curves so freak what you heard
Rollin' with the phatness
You don't even know what the half is
You got to pay to play
Just for shorty, bang-bang, to look your way
I like the way you work it
Trumped tight, all day, every day
You're blowing my mind, maybe in time
Baby, I can get you in my ride

[Chorus: x4]

Cause that's my peeps and we rolls deep
Flying first class from New York City to Blackstreet
What you know about me, not a motherfucking thing
Cartier wooded frames sported by my shortie
As for me, icy gleaming pinky diamond ring
We be's the baddest clique up on the scene
Ain't you getting bored with these fake ass broads
I shows and proves, no doubt, I predicted so
Please excuse, if I come across rude
That's just me
And that's how a playette's got to be
Stay kicking game with a capital G
Ask the peoples on my block, I'm as real as can be
Word is born, faking moves never been my thing
So, Teddy, pass the word to your nigga Chauncy
I'll be sitting in car, let's say around 3:30
Queen Pen and Blackstreet, it's no diggity

[Chorus: x4]
