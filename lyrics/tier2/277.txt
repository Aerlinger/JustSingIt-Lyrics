I love you
But I don't think I can love you anymore

When I kiss you so good
Why would you wanna break up?
When this lovin' is so good
Why would you wanna break up?

When I hit that so good
Why would you wanna break up?
When this feelin' is so good
Why would you wanna break up?

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up?

Do anythin' for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See, I been drivin' through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

Now baby girl had dumped me, she no longer wants me
I'm no longer hired, she said that I've been fired
On to the next one, more fish in the sea
Girls are like buses, miss one, next fifteen, one comin'

Gucci Mane crazy and his ice game stuntin'
Swag so stupid still the bitch straight dumped me
Over, no more smokin' doja
Baby girl went AWOL, she used to be my soulja

Don't, don't I lace you with the Gucci?
Don't, don't I deck you in the Louis?
Don't, don't I make your earlobe freeze?
Don't, don't when I dive, I dive deep?

I know I be gone
I know I be gone
I know I be flirtin' with the girls

I know I be
Sayin' I'll be right back but take too long
I know I be
Sayin' I'll be faithful but I don't

I know I be makin' you them promises
Him breakin' your heart again
Tellin' you she wasn't who she was
Then we arguin' but baby I love you, oh

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up?

Do anythin' for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See, I been drivin' through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up?

Do anythin' for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See, I been drivin' through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

You might be familiar but to me you're a model
Everything that I ever seen in a model
If you leavin', baby, don't leave me till tomorrow
Tonight we gon' get a lil' tipsy with a bottle

You gon' get me up, I'ma take 'em down
I'ma change my ways, we can work it out
Girl, I wouldn't be the same
If you was with somebody else
Girl, it wouldn't be the same
If I was with somebody else

I know I made mistakes before
Promise you won't get hurt no more
I got what you like and you know
Once you lay down, it's on

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up?

Do anythin' for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See, I been drivin' through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up?

Do anythin' for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See, I been drivin' through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

Why you wanna leave me? You should wanna tease me
Bein' Icy ain't easy, I make it look easy
Used to cover ya belly, let ya rock Louis
Now it's fuck shorty, I don't like Gucci

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up?

Do anythin' for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See, I been drivin' through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

Lovin' you, lovin' you, lovin' you
When I'm, when I'm lovin' you, lovin' you
Why would you wanna break up?

Do anythin' for you
Why would you wanna break up?
See, I been drivin' through your hood
Why would you wanna break up?

Why would you break up, break up, break up? Yeah
I'm back, baby
