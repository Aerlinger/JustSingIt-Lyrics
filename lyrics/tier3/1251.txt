Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it now
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now
Say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it, say it now
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it now

Instead of carving up the wall
Why dont you open up, we talk?
I am ready, I am ready for a fall

Instead of carving up the wall
Why dont you open up, we talk?
We are ready, we are ready for the floor

I cant hear your voice, do I have a choice?
Im hoping with chance, you might take this dance

I cant hear your voice, do I have a choice?
(Youre sinking below, Im using my force)
Im hoping with chance, you might take this dance
Youre my number one guy

Instead of carving up the wall
Why dont you open up, we talk?
I am ready, I am ready for a fall

Instead of carving up the wall
Why dont you open up, we talk?
We are ready, we are ready for the floor

I cant hear your voice, do I have a choice?
(Youre sinking below, Im using my force)
Im hoping with chance, you might take this dance
Youre my number one guy

Number one guy
Number, number, number, number, number
One, one, one, one, one guy

(Number one guy)
Instead of carving up the wall
(One, one guy)
Why dont you open up, we talk?
(Number, number, number one)
I am ready, I am ready for a fall

(Number one, number one)
Instead of carving up the wall
(Number one, one, one)
Why dont you open up, we talk
(Guy, guy)
We are ready, we are ready for the floor

(Number one guy)
Instead of carving up the wall
(Number, number, one, one)
Why dont you open up, we talk?
(Guy)
I am ready, I am ready for a fall

(Youre my number one guy, number one)
Instead of carving up the wall
(Number, number, one, one)
Why dont you open up, we talk?
(Number, number, one, one)
We are ready, we are ready for the floor
