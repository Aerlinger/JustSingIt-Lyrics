All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down, they got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

Let's paint the picture of the perfect place
They got it better than what anyone's told you
They'll be the king of hearts and you're the queen of spades
And we'll fight for you like we were your soldiers

I know we got it good, but they got it made
And the grass is getting greener each day
I know things are looking up, but soon they'll take us down
Before anybody's knowing our name, they got

All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down, they got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

Everybody knows, everybody knows where were going
Yeah, we're going down, they said
Everybody knows, everybody knows where were going
Yeah, we're going down

Do you think I'm special? Do you think I'm nice?
Am I bright enough to shine in your spaces?
Between the noise you hear and the sound you like
Are we just sinking in the ocean of faces?

It can't be possible, that rain can fall
Only when it's over right here
The sun is shining everyday but it's far away
Over the world they say, they got, they got

All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down, they got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

Everybody knows, everybody knows where were going
Yeah, we're going down, they said
Everybody knows, everybody knows where were going
Yeah, we're going down

It don't matter what you see, I know I could never be
Someone that'll look like you
It don't matter what you say, I know I could never face
Someone that could sound like you

All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down, they got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

All the right friends in all the right places
So yeah, we're going down, they got
All the right moves and all the right faces
So yeah, we're going down

Everybody knows, everybody knows where were going
Yeah, we're going down, they said
Everybody knows, everybody knows where were going
Yeah, we're going down

Yeah, we're going down
Yeah, we're going down
All the right moves, hey
Yeah, we're going down
All the right moves, hey
Yeah, we're going down
