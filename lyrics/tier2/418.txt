You've been waiting so long
I'm here to answer your call
I know that I shouldn't of had you waiting at all
I been so busy
But I've been thinking about what I wanna do with you
I know them other guys
They been talking about
The way I do what I do
They heard I was good
They wanna see if its true
They know ya the one I wanna give it to
I can see you want me to
Well it's me and you

It's me and you (now)
I've been waiting
Think I wanna make a move now
Baby tell me if you like it (Tell me if you like it) x2

I was waiting for you
To tell me you were ready
I know what to do
If only you would let me
As long as your cool with it I'll treat you right
Here is where you wanna be

I know them other guys
They been talking about the way I do what I do
They heard I was good
They wanna see if its true
They know your the one I wanna give it to
I can see you want me to
And now it's me and you

It's me and you now
I've been waiting
Think I wanna make a move now
Baby tell me if you like it
(Tell me if you like it) x2

Baby I, love you all the way down
Get it right where you like it
I promise, you'll like it (I swear)
Just relax and let me make
A move
Its our secret
That we'll keep between me and you

It's me and you now
I've been waiting
Think I wanna make a move now
Baby tell me if you like it
(Baby tell me if you like it) x2

(It just me and you)
(make a move now)
..-Fades out-..
