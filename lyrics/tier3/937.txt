Have you ever felt like everybody's watching
Waiting for you to lose
Have you ever felt like you're living in a spot light
Searching for the real you
Tell me have you ever woken up
Just to wish you could close your eyes
Getting hard to find a friend in a city like this
Where you can't even trust a smile

There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you're feeling short of breathe
Like the whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

[Chorus]
Don't kick the chair
It's gonna get better
Don't kick the chair
It can only get better

[Dia Frampton - Verse 2]
Have you ever felt love, really really felt love
The kind that could save a life
But right before you know it you find out in a moment
You're gonna have to say goodbye

There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you're feeling short of breath
Like the whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

[Chorus]
Don't kick the chair
It's gonna get better
Don't kick the chair
It can only get better

[Kid Cudi]
Yep yep you know
If I can make it through then you can to
Yep yep I'm good focus like always
Feels like I've been hit hit hit by ten brick walls
Some people like to just sit sit around and wait for you to fall
Then bounce back way quicker than you fell down
Laugh in their face like what
See nothing can break me
No no no no listen
If you gotta think twice about life
Something really ain't right
You don't need no help
You could be better all by yourself
You could be better all by yourself
You could be better all by yourself yeah
You could be better all by yourself ooh

[Chorus]
Don't kick the chair
It's gonna get better
Don't kick the chair
It can only get better

Don't kick the chair
It's gonna get better
Don't kick the chair
It can only get better
