26 There's a long black train20 Coming down the line* 46 Feeding off the souls that are lost and crying30 Rails of sin only evil remains* 43 Watch out brother for that long black train0 19 Look to the heavens25 You can look to the skies23 You can find redemption27 Staring back into your eyes32 There is protection and there is* 43 Peace the same burn in your ticket for that16 Long black train0 40 'Cause there's victory in the lord I say19 Victory in the lord37 Cling to the father and his holy name* 44 And don't go riding on that long black train0 * 42 There's a enginer on that long black train* 48 Making you wonder if your ride is worth the pain40 He's just a waitin' on your heart to say36 Let me ride on that long black train0 * 46 But you know there's victory in the lord I say19 Victory in the lord37 Cling to the father and his holy name* 44 And don't go riding on that long black train0 * 44 Well I can hear the whistle from a mile away17 It sounds so good20 But I must stay away* 45 That train is a beauty making everybody stare* 49 But its only destination is the middle of nowhere0 * 46 But you know there's victory in the lord I say19 Victory in the lord37 Cling to the father and his holy name* 44 And don't go riding on that long black train0 * 84 I said cling to the father and his holy name and don't go ridin' on that black train* 47 Yes watch out brother for that long black train* 45 That devil's a drivin' that long black train.0 11 Songwriters12 TURNER, JOSH0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 62 Read more: Josh Turner - Long Black Train Lyrics | MetroLyrics
