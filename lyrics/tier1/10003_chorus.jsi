[:chorus:]
Take on me
(take on me)
Take me on
(take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

So needless to say, i'm odds and ends
But i'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me, it's no better to be safe than sorry

[:chorus:]
Take on me
(take on me)
Take me on
(take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
