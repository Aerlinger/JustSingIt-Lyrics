It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?

I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Man, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

Tried my best at moving on
Have yet to find a girl like you
See things that I didn't before
Now I'm wishing I had more time with you

How do you stay awake
Knowing all I do is think of you?
All the things we thought about
That never will happen again
I can just see you

If I had my way I'd come and get ya girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to walk
And did all those things to steal your heart

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?

I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Man, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep?

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?

I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Man, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

Baby, all that I hear from my friends again, again and again
(Compliments 'bout you, they say)
We saw your girl at the game
And man, we gotta say, a big mistake by you

Not only do I miss your ways
But I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you gettin' no sleep
Can't think, can't eat until I come see you

If I had my way I'd come and get ya girl
In your favorite car with the missing top
Remember 'round my way where we used to walk
And did all those things to steal your heart

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?

I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Man, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?

I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Man, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep?

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I been missing you crazy
How do you, how do you sleep?

I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Man, those sweet memories
How do you, how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?
