[:chorus:]
Where do you go, my lovely?
Where do you go?
I wanna know, my lovely, i wanna know

Where do you go, oh, oh, eh, oh?
I wanna know, oh, oh, eh, oh
Where do you go, oh, oh, eh, oh?
I wanna know
You leave without a word, no message, no number
And now my head is pounding like rolling thunder
You left me with a heartache deep inside
Girl, you should see me cry all night, and i wonder
Everybody says, "what a shame, what is wrong?"
They don't like the game we play
Heard you're hanging 'round every night until dawn
I'm waiting for you night and day

[:chorus:]
Where do you go, my lovely?
Where do you go?
I wanna know, my lovely, i wanna know
