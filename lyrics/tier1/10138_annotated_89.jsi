24 In the day, in the night24 Say it right, say it all30 You either got it or you don't28 You either stand or you fall0 24 When your will is broken29 When it slips from your hands31 When there's no time for joking26 There's a hole in the plan0 39 Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me39 No, you don't mean nothing at all to me* 43 Oh, you've got what it takes to set me free35 Oh, you could mean everything to me0 39 I can't say that I'm not lost and found* 52 I can't say that I don't love the light and the dark* 45 I can't say that I don't know that I am alive* 47 And all of what I feel I could show you tonight0 39 Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me39 No, you don't mean nothing at all to me* 43 Oh, you've got what it takes to set me free35 Oh, you could mean everything to me0 * 51 From my hands I can give you, something that I made* 54 From my mouth I can sing you another brick that I laid* 46 From my body I can show you a place, God knows* 57 If you know this place is holy, do you really want to go?0 11 Songwriters* 46 FURTADO, NELLY / HILLS, NATE / MOSLEY, TIMOTHY0 12 Published by* 89 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Warner/Chappell Music, Inc., EMI Music Publishing0 0 0 * 60 Read more: Nelly Furtado - Say It Right Lyrics | MetroLyrics
