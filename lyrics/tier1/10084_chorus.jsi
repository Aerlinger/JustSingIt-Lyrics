[:chorus:]
A b c is easy as like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be

Now i'm gonna teach you how to sing it out
Come on, come on, come on
Let me show you what it's all about
A b c is easy as like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
Now i'm gonna teach you how to
Sing it out, sing it out, sing it out, sing it out

[:chorus:]
A b c is easy it's like counting up to three
Sing a simple melody
That's how easy love can be
