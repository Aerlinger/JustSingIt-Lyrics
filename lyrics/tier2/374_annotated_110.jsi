16 In this farewell16 There's no blood16 There's no alibi23 Cause I've drawn regret14 From the truth18 Of a thousand lies0 17 So let mercy come13 And wash away0 14 What I've done16 I'll face myself29 To cross out what I've become12 Erase myself28 And let go of what I've done0 11 Put to rest22 What you thought of me24 While I clean this slate14 With the hands14 Of uncertainty0 17 So let mercy come13 And wash away0 14 What I've done16 I'll face myself29 To cross out what I've become12 Erase myself28 And let go of what I've done0 18 For what I've done16 I'll start again26 And whatever pain may come15 Today this ends28 I'm forgiving what I've done0 16 I'll face myself29 To cross out what I've become12 Erase myself28 And let go of what I've done0 13 (Na-na na na)13 (Na-na na na)13 (Na-na na na)14 What I've done13 (Na-na na na)0 13 (Na-na na na)13 (Na-na na na)13 (Na-na na na)24 Forgiving what I`ve done13 (Na-na na na)0 13 (Na-na na na)13 (Na-na na na)13 (Na-na na na)10 (Na-na na)0 11 Songwriters* 110 BENNINGTON, CHESTER CHARLES / BOURDON, ROBERT G. / DELSON, BRAD / SHINODA, MIKE / FARRELL, DAVE / HAHN, JOSEPH0 12 Published by* 41 Lyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Group0 0 0 * 60 Read more: Linkin Park - What I've Done Lyrics | MetroLyrics
