It's been a long time comin' since I've seen your face
I've been everywhere and back tryin' to replace
everything that I've had til my feet went numb
Praying like a fool that's been on the run
Heart's still beating but it's not working
It's like a million dollar phone that just can't ring
I reached out tried to love but I feel nothing
Yeah, my heart is numb

But With you
I feel again
Yeah with you
I can feel again

Yeah

Woo-hoo (x4)

I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me

It's been a long time comin' since I seen your face
I've been everywhere and back tryin' to replace
everything that I broke til my feet went numb
Praying like a fool that just shot of a gun
Heart's still beating but it's not working
It's like a hundred thousand voices that just can't sing
I reach out tried to love but I feel nothing
Oh, my heart is numb

But With you
I feel again
Yeah with you
I can feel again

But with you
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I feel again
(I was a lonely soul but that's the old me)
Yeah with you
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
I can feel again
(I was a lonely soul)

Woo-hooo

Woo-hooo (x4)

(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)
(I'm feeling better ever since you know me)
(I was a lonely soul, but that's the old me)

I'm feeling better ever since you know me
I was a lonely soul but that's the old me

A little wiser now
from what you showed me
Yeah, I feel again
Feel again
