What's up man, hey, yo, what's up?

Sick an' tired of five, oh, runnin' up on the block here

Police them come an' now they blow down me door
One him come crawl through through my window
So then they put me in the back the car at the station
From that point on me reach my destination

Police knock my door lick up my pal
Rough me up an' I can't do a thing
Pick up my line when my telephone ring

Take me to the station black up my hands
Trail me down 'cuz I'm hangin' with the Snowman
What I'm gonna do I'm backed an' I'm trapped
Slap me in the face an' took all o' my gap
They have no clues an' they wanna get warmer
But Shan won't turn informer

Informer you no say daddy me Snow me I'll go blame
A licky boom, boom down
Detective mon said daddy me Snow me stab someone down the lane
A licky boom, boom down
