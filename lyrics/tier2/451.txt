Woo womp, womp, woo womp, womp
Woo womp, woo womp
It's what your body sayin'
Woo womp, womp, woo womp, womp
Woo womp, woo womp
Chris Brown is in the building

The young boy just turned 16
And I got 64's and hot bikes that I rock
Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on my clock
But all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em vicious

Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop
'Cause you speaking that slang that I talk
That sassy tempo with that walk
May be the reason that all these teenies may never see me

Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac,
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme

Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme

Ma, take a break, let me explain to you
What ya body got a young boy ready to do
If you take a chance to let me put them things on you
I could show you why I make them straight A's in school

I'm a hustla, trust my frame and age
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page
I can picture us switching lanes in the coupe
With you on the phone screaming my name
(Chris!)

Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme

Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme

Woo womp, womp, woo womp, womp
Woo womp, woo womp
Girl you serious and I been watching you
Woo womp, womp, woo womp, womp
Woo womp, woo womp
This' what your body's saying

Woo womp, womp, woo womp, womp
Woo womp, woo womp
(Yeah)
Woo womp, womp, woo womp, womp
Woo womp, woo womp
This what your body's sayin'
(Oww)

Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme

Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot
(Gimme that)
You be talking like you like what I got
(Gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying gimme gimme, gimme

V.A.

Yeah, ma don't be frontin' like
You don't know what's goin' on
Aight? Yeah
