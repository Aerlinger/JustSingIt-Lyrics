(Let's work) My motherfucker is a billionaire motherfucker!
(Let's work) You heard that shit I said my motherfucker, is a billionaire motherfucker

(Let's work) D boy drug dealer look, billionaire
D boy drug dealer look, billionaire
From the coca leafs to the farmers (Ooh)
To the polo fleece to the bombers (Ooh)
R.I.P. to Gianni (Ooh)
Now we on our way (Let's work)
D boy drug dealer look, billionaire (Let's work)

Bally shoes, Gucci sneakers
Pharrell's a pharaoh, peep the features
Unlaced Adidas
Top of the world like pyramids in Giza
Uh Fila sweats, 88 I rocked a mock neck
Carried a nine in my projects
Bucket hat EPMD cassettes
Now I'm smoking loud in Ibiza
Mix the D'USSE with the reefer
My whole life is leisure
Gangsta lean like the Pisa
Eiffel Tower, Hermes towel
The Feds is perched like an owl
Real niggas all feel the hook

D boy drug dealer look (Let's work) billionaire
D boy drug dealer look (Let's work) billionaire nigga
From the coca leafs to the farmers (Ooh)
To the polo fleece to the bombers (Ooh)
R.I.P. to Gianni (Ooh)
Now we on our way eh (Let's work)
D boy drug dealer look (Let's work) billionaire ('naire)

Let me make sure you hear my mufuckin' jewelry (Let's work)
What you know about going out, head west
Maybach, 3 TV's all up in the headrest
Mase niggas at Madison Square Garden
20 million sold and we still catching charges
Rope chains, Rakim and Eric B
Bought my sidekicks Suzuki Jeeps and Cherokees
Hoop earrings, coupes with the rear cameras
Put that bitch in a cherry M3
I'm not your average dope dealer
Silver Toyotas four runners and four wheelers
Me and Teflon Q45 infinite
Windows tinted, white girl all in it uh
Britney, bitch
MCM seats buck 50 stitch uh
Versace plates got the Basquiat collab from Versace's place uh
Cuban link 5 kilo
Your life is illegal when your chain can get the RICO uh
Real niggas all feel the hook

(Let's work) D boy drug dealer look (Let's work) billionaire
D boy drug dealer look (Let's work) billionaire nigga
From the coca leafs to the farmers (Ooh)
To the polo fleece to the bombers (Ooh)
R.I.P. to Gianni (Ooh)
Now we on our way eh
(Let's work) D boy drug dealer look (Let's work) billionaire
D boy drug dealer look (Let's work) billionaire nigga
From the coca leafs to the farmers (Ooh)
To the polo fleece to the bombers (Ooh)
R.I.P. to Gianni (Ooh)
Now we on our way eh
(Let's work) D boy drug dealer look (Let's work) billionaire ('naire)
