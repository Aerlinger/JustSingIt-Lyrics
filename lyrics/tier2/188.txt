One love, one love
Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull
Y'all know what time it is?

We go set it off tonight, just go
Set the club on fire, just go
Enrique, hollah at 'em like

Girl, please excuse me
If I'm coming too strong
But tonight is the night
We can really let go

My girlfriend's out of town
And I'm all alone
Your boyfriend's on vacation
And he doesn't have to know

No, oh, oh, oh, oh
No one can do the things
I'm gonna wanna do to you

No, oh, oh, oh, oh
Shout aloud, screaming aloud
Let me hear you go

Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more

Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it, I, I, I like it

Party, karamu, fiesta, forever

Girl, please excuse me
If I'm misbehaving, oh
I'm trying keep my hands off
But you're begging me for more

'Round, 'round, 'round
Baby, low, low, low
Let the time, time pass
'Cause we're never getting old

No, oh, oh, oh, oh
No one can do it better
Turn around, I'll give you more

No, oh, oh, oh, oh
Shout aloud, screaming aloud
Let me hear you go

Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more

Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it, I, I, I like it

Come DJ, that's my DJ
I'm a Miami boy, you know how we play
I ain't playing with ya, but I wanna play
What you give me got me good, now watch me

It's a different species, meet me in DC
Let's party on the White House lawn
Tiger Woods times Jesse James equals Pitbull all night long
Pick up Barack and Michelle, let 'em know that it's on

Pa' fuera, pa' la calle
Dale mamita trame ese baile
Dale mamita trame ese baile

I see you watchin' me
You see me watchin' you
I love the way you move
I like them things you do like

Don't stop, baby, don't stop, baby
Just keep on shaking my love
I won't stop, baby, won't stop, baby
Until you get enough

Party, karamu, fiesta, forever

Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more

Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it, I, I, I like it

Baby, I like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby, I like it
Come on and give me some more

Oh yes, I like it
Screaming like never before
Baby, I like it, I, I, I like it

Party, karamu, fiesta, forever
Oh yes, I like it
Party, karamu, fiesta, forever
Oh yes, I like it
