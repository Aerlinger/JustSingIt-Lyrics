Hey girl, I'm waitin' on ya, I'm waitin' on ya
Come on and let me sneak you out
And have a celebration, a celebration
The music up, the windows down

ZAYN MALIK:
Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool
And we know it too
Yeah, we'll keep doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool
So tonight

ALL:
Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy till we see the sun
I know we only met but let's pretend it's love
And never, never, never stop for anyone
Tonight let's get some
And live while we're young
Woahhh oh oh oh
Woahhhh oh oh oh
And live while we're young
Woahhh oh oh oh
Tonight let's get some

HARRY STYLES:
And live while we're young

ZAYN MALIK:
Hey girl, it's now or never, it's now or never
Don't over-think, just let it go
And if we get together, yeah, get together
Don't let the pictures leave your phone, ohhhh

NIALL HORAN:
Yeah, we'll be doing what we do
Just pretending that we're cool
So tonight
