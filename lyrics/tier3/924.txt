Don't look ahead there's stormy weather
Another road block in our way
But if we go, we go together
Our hands are tied here if we stay
Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don't fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know now we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know that we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
So let them say we can't do better
Lay out the rules that we can't break
They want to sit and watch it wither
Their legacy's too hard to take
Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don't fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know now we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know that we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
In their heads, hedging their bets, in their eyes it shows
When the beacon breaks, what then you ask and they don't know
Oh tell me that I turn my back, well, the odds all stand beneath me
And they all said I was misled, but now the odds all stand beneath me
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
They're frozen to the core
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh, we said our dreams will carry us
And if they don't fly we will run
Now we push right past to find out
How to win what they all lost
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know that we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
We know that we want more
Oh-ah, Oh-ah
A life worth fighting for
