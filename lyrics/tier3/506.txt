Weren't you the one who said that you don't want me anymore
And how you need your space and give the keys back to your door
And how I cried and tried and tried to make you stay with me
And still you said your love was gone and that I had to leave
Now you're talking 'bout a family
Now you're saying I complete your dreams
Oh
Now you're sayin' I'm your everything
You're confusing me
What you saying to me, don't play wit me, don't play wit me
'Cause

What goes around comes around?
What goes up must come down?
Now who's cryin', desirin', to come back to me
What goes around comes around?
What goes up must come down?
Now who's cryin', desirin', to come back

I remember when I was sittin' home alone
Waitin' for you til three o'clock in the 'morn
And when you came home you'd always have some sorry excuse
Half explaining to me like I'm just some kind of a fool
I sacrificed the things I wanted just to do things for you
But when it's time to do for me
You never come through
Now you wanna be up under me
Now you have so much to say to me
Now you wanna make time for me
Whatcha doin' to me, you're confusin' me
Don't play with me, don't play with me cause

What goes around comes around?
What goes up must come down?
Now who's cryin', desirin', to come back to me
What goes around comes around?
What goes up must come down?
Now who's cryin', desirin', to come back

I remember when I was sittin' home alone
Waitin' for you till three o'clock in the 'morn
Night after night knowing something goin' on
Wasn't long before I be gone
Lord knows it wasn't easy believe me
Never thought you'd be the one that would deceive me
And never do what you're supposed to do
No need to approach me fool, 'cuz I'm over you

What goes around comes around?
What goes up must come down?
Now who's cryin', desirin', to come back to me
What goes around comes around?
What goes up must come down?
Gotta stop trying to come back to me

What goes around comes around?
What goes up must come down?
It's called Karma, baby and it goes around
What goes around comes around?
What goes up must come down?
Now who's cryin', desirin', to come back to me
