[:chorus:]
Woo hoo
When i feel heavy metal
Woo hoo!
And i'm pins and i'm needles
Woo hoo!
Well i lie and i'm easy
All of the time
But i'm never sure
Why i need you
Pleased to meet you

I got my head done
When i was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

[:chorus:]
Woo hoo!
When i feel heavy metal
Woo hoo!
And i'm pins and i'm needles
Woo hoo!
Well i lie and i'm easy
All of the time
But i'm never sure
Why i need you
Pleased to meet you
