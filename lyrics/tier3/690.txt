If I cannot sleep with you, maybe I could have a taste
Put your naughty on my tongue and your booty on my face
If I cannot sleep with you, maybe I could have a taste
Put your naughty on my tongue and your booty on my face

Boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)

Wayoh, wayoh, wayoh
Wayoh, wayoh

I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)

I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)

Girl your booty is so round
I just wanna lay you down
Let me take you from behind
I won't cum until it's time

But if I cannot sleep with you
Maybe I could have a taste
Put your niney on my tongue
And your booty on my face

Ow, I came to make you shake it
Till you break it
Caress your body until you're naked
Bend you over, grab your shoulder

Slip my peter inside your folder
Make you sweat-a, get you wet-a
Pump it faster to make it better
Dim the the lights then lock the room
'Cos now it's time for me to hit that boom

I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)

Girl your booty is so round
I just wanna lay you down
Let me take you from behind
I won't come until it's time

But if I cannot sleep with you
Maybe I could have a taste
Put your niney on my tongue
And your booty on my face

Geronimo, look out below
Here comes the brother with the offbeat flow
I just fell from the mothership
Outhere Brothers 'bout to rip it on another tip, slip

Don't trip, check out how I do it
Malik is in the house, I turn your body into fluid
As I come from the depths of doom
I snap back at you ow, with the boom

I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)

I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)

Let me hear you say wayoh
Let me hear you say wayoh
Let, let, let me hear you say wayoh
Let me hear you say
Let, let, let me hear you say wayoh

Ow, I came to make you shake it
Till you break it
Caress your body until you're naked
Bend you over, grab your shoulder

Slip my peter inside your folder
Make you sweat-a, get you wet-a
Pump it faster to make it better
Dim the the lights then lock the room
'Cos now it's time for me to hit that boom

I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)

I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom now let me hear you say wayoh
(Wayoh)
I say, boom boom boom muthafucka say wayoh
(Wayoh)
