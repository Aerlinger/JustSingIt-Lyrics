Everybody's doin' a brand new dance now
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion
I know you'll get to like it if you give it a chance, now
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion

My little baby sister can do it with ease
It's easier to learn than your A B C's
So come on, come on and do the loco-motion with me

You got to swing your hips now
Come on, jump up, jump back
Oh, babe, I think you got the knack, whoa, whoa

Now that you can do it, well let's make a chain now
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion
A chugga, chugga motion like a railroad train now
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion

Do it nice and easy, now, and don't lose control
A little bit of rhythm and a lot of soul
Well, come on, come on, and do the loco-motion with me

Whoa whoa, move around the floor in a loco-motion
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion
Do it holdin' hands, if'n you get the notion
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion

There's never been a dance that's so easy to do
It even makes you happy when you're feelin' blue
So come on, come on, and do the loco-motion with me
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion

So come on, come on, and do the loco-motion with me
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion
So come on, come on, and do the loco-motion with me

Come on, baby, do the loco-motion
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion
Come on, baby, do the loco-motion
