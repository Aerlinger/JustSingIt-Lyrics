Explain [Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Wake up feeling blessed up
Pistol on that dresser
Aint afraid to show it, Ill expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testarossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup till Im messed up like yes sir
So now Im getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you probably own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, Im pimpin hoes
You could tell by my paystubs
My niggas getting right, smoking weed with dirty sprite
Going wild for the night, fuck being polite
Finna wild out for the weekend
Me, myself, and I my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, ASAP niggas finnna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP, we the trillest
You dont really want that Glock boy
You dont really wanna feel them shots boy
You a B boy, Im a block boy
Im a D boy, Im a hot boy
Six shots got me feeling like Pac boy
Party all night, shit dont stop boy
Drunk as fuck and Im ready to fight
Wildin' for the night, fuck being polite boy

[Hook]
Wild for the night, fuck being polite
I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite
I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite
I'm going
Wild for the night, fuck being polite
I'm going

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Its the weekend and Im creepin with my niggas
Drunk and disrespectful, calling women bitches
I dont mean no harm but wont you and your friends
Meet us in the cut and we can do the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And yo girl just said they with us
So we rolling in them Benzes
Wont you po' it up and stop the babysitting?
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids
Back to the Mac, tats on her back
Ass so fat, hit that from the back
When it clap from the back, she clapping it back
She flat on her back and its back to the trap
Fuck yo pack, A$AP where its at
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck yo dreams, even fuck niggas dream
Then you sleep, and you wont come back from the nap
Benjamin 3 stack, its a fact, she lives in my lap
On my Outkast, daddy fat, bitches on my sack
And you know them soak and bitches rolling reefer got me open
Wilding to the morning with my homies, tell em where we going

[Hook]
