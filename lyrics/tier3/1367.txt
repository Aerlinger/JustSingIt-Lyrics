We are the desperate ones
Looking for the mark
We are the lonely ones
Left out here in the dark
We bought our tickets but we
Don't have a seat
And now we're just
Slaves to the beat
We are the tired ones
Tired of too much sleep
Tired of searching for
The words we can't repeat
Don't mean to scare you but it's
Getting too warm and I
Think I'm gonna move
To the Door
We are burning
This is real
We're on fire but
We can't feel a thing
We were promised
More than we could take
Everybody out it's a
Fire Escape
Gather around my friends
Let's try not to pretend
There is a war between
The cold out there
And the fire within
I know we're alive
I know that we can die
Right into the thick of it
We are burning
This is real
We're on fire but
We can't feel a thing
We were promised
More than we could take
Everybody out it's a
Fire Escape
I don't want to fill my body
With drugs I can't even name
I'm tired of feeling the same
I want to feel something
We are burning
This is real
We're on fire
Don't you feel
We were made to
Be more than just awake
Everybody out it's a
Fire Escape
We are burning
This is real
We're on fire but
We can't feel a thing
We were promised
More than we could take
Everybody out it's a
Fire Escape
