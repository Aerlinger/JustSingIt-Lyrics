Baby if you could would you go back to the start?
Take any fresh steps or watch it all fall apart, again.
Play another song here, then you can leave,
With your delicate wings, I use to weave.

Maybe there's an under-tow pier,
Or maybe this is stuck up in the air.
I know how it looks but all that glitters ain't gold.

You gave me magical,
I gave you wonderful.
Cut that invisible cord or I'll starve you of
What's understandable,
Let's make immeasurable,
Moves to the left or the right on no schedule

(X2)

'Cause you gave me magical,
I gave you wonderful,
Let's make this biblical
And hang from our invisible cords.

Baby if you could would you go back to the start?
Take any fresh steps or watch it all fall apart, again.
It could have been a wonderful year.
Instead we might not make it to the end.
Everybody cares but nobody knows.

You gave me magical,
I gave you wonderful.
Cut that invisible cord or I'll starve you of
What's understandable,
Let's make immeasurable,
Moves to the left or the right on no schedule.

(X2)

'Cause you gave me magical,
I gave you wonderful,
Let's make this biblical
And hang from our invisible cords.

(X2)

(Wooooaaaah)
Baby how can you walk away?

(X8)

Baby if you could would you go back to the start?
Take any fresh steps or watch it all fall apart, again.
