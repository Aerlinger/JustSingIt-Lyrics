Bring the action

When your hear us in the club
You gotta turn the shit up
You gotta turn the shit up
You gotta turn the shit up

When we up in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

See the boys in the club
They watching us
They watching us
They watching us

Everybody in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
and scream and shout and let it out
We say oh we oh we oh we oh
We say oh we oh we oh we oh
I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
and scream and shout and let it out
We say oh we oh we oh we oh

You are now now rocking with
will.i.am and Britney bitch
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Bring the action

Rock and roll
Everybody let's lose control
On the bottom we let it go
Going fast, we ain't going slow-low-low
Hey yo
Hear the beat, now let's hit the floor
Drink it up and then drink some more
Light it up and let's let it blow

Hey yo
Rock it out and rock it now
If you know what we talking about
Turn it up and burn down the house ha house
Hey yo
Turn it up and go turn it down
Here we go we go shake the ground
Cause everywhere we go we
Bring the action

When your hear us in the club
You gotta turn the shit up
You gotta turn the shit up
You gotta turn the shit up

When we up in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

You see them girls in the club
They looking at us
They looking at us
They looking at us

Everybody in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
and scream and shout and let it out
We say oh we oh we oh we oh
We say oh we oh we oh we oh
I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
and scream and shout and let it out
We say oh we oh we oh we oh

You are now now rocking with
will.i.am and Britney bitch
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Bring the action

It goes on and on and on and on
When me and you party together
I wish this night would last forever
Cause I was feeling down and now feel better
And maybe It goes on and on and on and on
When me and you party together
I wish this night would last forever
Ever ever ever ever

I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
and scream and shout and let it out
We say oh we oh we oh we oh
We say oh we oh we oh we oh
I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
and scream and shout and let it out
We say oh we oh we oh we oh
We say oh we oh we oh we oh
I wanna scream and shout and let it all out
and scream and shout and let it out
We say oh we oh we oh we oh

You are now now rocking with
will.i.am and Britney bitch
