[Chorus]

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, you're like a needle in a haystack
Uh, I wanna sit you where my face at
Uh, lunch with a few Mai-Tais
Uh, purple kisses on my tie
Uh, life can leave a @#$% loved
Uh, now you gettin this @#$%, love
Uh, I'm lookin for you with a flashlight
I wanna feel what a real fat @#$% like
No injection, I learned my lesson
I walk it like I talk it, baby this pedestrian
Runnin through your mind like Jackie Joyner
@#$% like pop like "DO!" Go get me a burner
Got shot like "DO!" This can be detrimental
T-shirt and panties, that's your credential
You're cotton candy, I need a fistful
I'm often antsy, hope that convince you

[Bridge]

[Chorus - repeat 2X]

[Robin Thicke]
I'll give it to you
