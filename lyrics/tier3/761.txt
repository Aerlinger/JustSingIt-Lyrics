Early in the mornings when I think about you
Yeah - I hit you like what you sayin'?
The mornings when I wanna fuck you
Yeah - I hit you like what you sayin'?
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time

M-O--T
That's the fuck we sippin'
That's the fuck we drippin'
Traphouse still tippin'
Facetime when I'm gone
She give me dome from a distance
And she love to climb on top
Cause she love to walk off limpin'
Pimps up, hoes down
Legs up or toes down
Why she jock me? Cause she knocked knees
And we got trees, so Mary go around
Gotta know I ate it
She so sweet, now and later
I want that all the time, all the time
Imma give you all of mine when its

Early in the mornings when I think about you
Yeah - I hit you like what you sayin'?
The mornings when I wanna fuck you
Yeah - I hit you like what you sayin'?
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time

Pussy for breakfast, thats how I start my day
My dick is a pen, its written all over her face
I put my tongue in her mouth, I make them pussy lips drool
She got that junk in her trunk, you know I like junk food
I tell her like this, life is good, your pussy better
I put on a magnum, like a gold medal
And if its sweet then Imma eat it til I get sugar diabetes
Im a blood and she anemic we perfect
Tunechi

Early in the mornings when I think about you
Yeah - I hit you like what you sayin'?
The mornings when I wanna fuck you
Yeah - I hit you like what you sayin'?
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time

Damn, damn lil mama, youre sticky, icky, icky
Got a nigga out here feelin picky, icky, icky
Every time you put it on, man, it leave me real trippy
Every time we on it we keep it 50-50
Dont let the time ticky, icky, icky
While Im snappin off your bra, and bitin on your titties
Feelin real tipsy gettin real freaky and its gettin real frisky
Never say no damn, shes so cold
Up and down that pole she go, go
Fuck me like you hate me, kiss me like you miss me
Anything I want to, thats what she always lets me

Early in the mornings when I think about you
Yeah - I hit you like what you sayin'?
The mornings when I wanna fuck you
Yeah - I hit you like what you sayin'?
I could fuck you all the time
I could fuck you all the time
