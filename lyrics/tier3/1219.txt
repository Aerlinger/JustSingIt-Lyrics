Hey, Ms. Red Carpet, she can autograph my pockets
Anytime, anyplace, anyway, I'll be looking at everybody else watchin'
I don't wanna be obnoxious, but this girl worth the gossip
Take it with a smile, the tattoos now, forever she very God-less

I imagine her topless, she might set off my rocket
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 on and poppin'
She mad marketed, attitude like we arguin'
With her by my side I bring glitter to my life, I should Twitter, "This girl is sparklin'"

She ain't no rock star but she got groupies
She ain't no actress but she make movies
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking they neck like

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

She ain't got riches but she got fashion
She ain't a model, but cameras flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking they neck like

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

Hey, I wanna know her mama name
'Cause that where she get from, they ain't never shot her with silicon
Shawty is her and her is she, the real one
Touch one, grab one, feel one

I wish she woulda told me that
Ain't nothing wrong bringing the old me back
Little mamma knows my body so trophy class
She worth every bit of some Chloe bags

Like damn, can I be yo' police badge?
Pull it over, get a little cozy and
Reminisce on her like a oldie jam
Record some on a Playboy cam

She ain't no actress
The movie for my mattress
Rock star, none of that practice
But still she got phonetics

She ain't no rock star but she got groupies
She ain't no actress but she make movies
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking they neck like

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

She ain't got riches but she got fashion
She ain't a model, but cameras flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking they neck like

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

Look at her, go, I wanna know
Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?
Look at her, go, I wanna know
Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

She ain't no rock star but she got groupies
She ain't no actress but she make movies
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking they neck like

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?

She ain't got riches but she got fashion
She ain't a model, but cameras flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking they neck like

Who dat girl? Who dat girl? Who dat girl?
