9 Chorus 1:0 34 I bought a bonnet to suit my face,37 I had my petticoat trimmed with lace,40 I looked at the mirror, around I twirled* 44 And then I went out in the wide, wide world.36 I dreamed of gentlemen I would meet,35 I saw them all kneeling at my feet,* 45 I can't understand it, my hair is all curled,* 43 But my goodness me, it's a great big world.26 And it's cold, cold, cold,22 And we'll soon be old.39 Alas and alack, it's a great big world.0 9 Chorus 2:0 39 I learned to sew and I learned to bake,29 I even frosted an angel cake,* 43 On Saturday evening, when folks dropped in,40 My house was as neat as a brand new pin.40 I thought by learning each social grace,38 Some likely chap might forget my face,* 47 I can't understand it, I've knitted and purled,* 43 But my goodness me, it's a great big world.26 And it's cold, cold, cold,22 And we'll soon be old.39 Alas and alack, it's a great big world.0 9 Chorus 3:0 37 I had no petticoat trimmed with lace,34 My angel cake was a pure disgrace,39 My face was my fortune, my mother said,* 46 And my dancing slippers of bright, bright red.39 A million miles I have danced, or more,* 47 In hopes Prince Charming would cross the floor,* 53 I can't understand it, I've waltzed and I've whirled,* 42 But my goodness me it's a great big world.26 And it's cold, cold, cold,22 And we'll soon be old.* 44 But I'll keep on knitting and doing it well,* 44 My slippers are one thing I never will sell,* 44 My petticoat's waiting because who can tell?* 47 It's a great big world, it's a great big world.0 0 0 * 75 Read more: Soundtrack Artists - It's A Great Big World Lyrics | MetroLyrics
