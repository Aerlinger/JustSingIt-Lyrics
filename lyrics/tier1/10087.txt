Superhighways, coast to coast, easy takin' anywhere
On the transcontinental overload, just slide behind the wheel
How does it feel when there's no destination that's too far?
And somewhere on the way you might find out who you are

Living in America
Eye to eye, station to station
Living in America
Hand in hand, across the nation
Living in America
I got to have a celebration, rock my soul

Smokestack, fatback, many miles of railroad track
All night radio keep on runnin' through your rock 'n' roll soul
All night diners keep you awake on a black coffee and a hard roll
You might have to walk a fine line, said you might take a hard line
But everybody's workin' overtime

Living in America
Eye to eye, station to station
Living in America
Hand in hand, across the nation
Living in America
I got to have a celebration

I live in America
Said, I live in America
Wait a minute

You may not be lookin' for the promised land
But you might find it anyway
Under one of those old familiar names like
New Orleans, Detroit City, Dallas
Pittsburgh P.A, New York City
Kansas, Atlanta, Chicago and L. A.

Living in America
Hit me
Living in America
Living in America

I live in America
Not yet
I live in America

Living in America
Eat your heart out
Living in America
Living in America
Hit me, yeah get me now
Living in America
Living in America
Yeah

I live in America
Staying alive, we'll make the prime
I live in America
Hey, I know what you mean

Living in America
Hit me, I said now, eye to eye, station to station
Living in America
Go scream, let me
Living in America
Ah, yes, now ain't it funky? But it's good
Living in America
So nice, would you better stop?
Living in America
I feel good

Kaufman, Charles / Hartman, Dan
