Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Every time one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Is it good that we hurt every day?
Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
I live the fast life, going nowhere fast
I see my past life and politely pass
But Im already planning on doing it big
For my life after death, I live my life after death
Baby what you think our train is for?
Thats to properly prepare you for war
So I keep you on your toes
So you could look out for your friends that are really foes
This career try to swallow us
Paparazzi try to follow us
Im everything that my mama was
Rider, survivor, a motherfuckin fighter
Thank god for this rapping shit
Forget the cash if Id happen this
No more life, thats for the birds
I work hard so you never say these words
Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Every time one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Is it good that we hurt every day?
Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
The critics going nowhere (nowhere)
Thinking that they know me like the Bible, oh hell no
But they dont understand me all well
Snitching is a sport now so please do tell
The world how I raise hell
Yea, so the clown when I skip jail
Im just tryina own teams, beat it playa
And dance on the globe like Fred Astaire
The world is ours baby
Its just waiting for us so dont be late
And we could both aim for the sky
And shoot for the stars and call it a day
Now you know that I know that we know
If the world wants war cock back and reload
A normal life, thats for the birds
I work hard, so you never say these words
Sooner or later that spark just disappears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Every time one of us ending up in tears
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
Is it good that we hurt every day?
Is this worth all the pain that we feel inside?
Am I too blind to see this is happening to me
Outta nowhere, outta nowhere
