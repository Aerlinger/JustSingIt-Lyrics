Purple hills

Purple hills

[chorus]
I been so many places
I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain
Once or twice but who's countin'
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple hills

[eminem]
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of lawsuits iside her palm
It's mr. mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like christopher reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people
And 5 I hit
Ah shit
I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick
And lost the foster kids
This room makes me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losing weight
Till I see dumb shit start happenin'
Dumber than vanilla ice tryin' to rap again
So bounce, bounce, c'mon bounce
I said c'mon bounce
Everybody in the house doin' mass amounts
To the women in the thongs, with they asses out
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bomb and gas your town
Bizarre, your mom is crashing out
Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out

[kon artist & kuniva]
Fuck that, someone help denaun
He's upstairs wrestling with elton john
Hey von, you see me stepping on these
eprechauns?

It gotta be tums the ex-lax is gone
Yeah I took a them all gone with some parmesian
And I think my arm is gone
Nah, it's probably numb
Young, dumb and full of shit
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm about to die when I just got off
Well stop acting stupid
You so high
That you might wake up with a guy on some new shit
I think I did too much
I think I got the runs
Rolaids, pepto, and tums
Watch out here it comes!

[chorus]

[hook]
Dirty dozen
80 of us
Shady brothers
Ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out
And date each other
Some-, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something
Umm I dunno

[proof]
Hop hills
Hills I hop
Hop two hills
On stilts I walk
Snort ? ? lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was incredible and can't ?
I wanna roll away
Like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
Yeah I'm gonna go for broke
I hope you don't
Pack up my nose with soap
*cough cough cough*
Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby
Born by whore lady
Now I'm paying child support
(it's your baby!)

[swifty]
I take four shots at one time
I don't need to chase when I'm swallowing mine
Hey you got any room
In bizarre's hatch back
We can't go far
'cause the car has flats
Why the hell you people think I rap?
Because my mother taught me
How to breach contracts
If you got cash
Then hide it soon
(swift, chill)
I just wanna get by like you
And I don't give a damn if you find me rude
Me, the crew, to hell with you too
I only need three blunts then I'm cool
I just got some and I'm going back soon

[chorus]

[bizarre]
I'm at rave
Looking at a babe
Like she want it
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smell like vomit
Looney, crazy, dopey headed, sexy head guy
Whipped cream, dirty mattresses
Wanna try
Blue hills, golden seals
Got bizarre actin' ill
Drugs kill
(yeah right)
Chick I'm for real
Shut your mouth you dirty girl
You know you want me in your world
Ladies, please don't fight
Bizarre's here all night!!!

[chorus]
