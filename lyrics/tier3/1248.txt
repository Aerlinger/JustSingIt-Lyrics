Fallen for a guy, fell down from the sky
Halo round his head
Feathers in a bed
In our bed, in our bed

Fallen for a guy, fell down from the sky
Halo round his head
Feathers in a bed
In our bed, in our bed

Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say

Ask if I will try
To leave this all behind
Halo round his head
Feathers in a bed
In our bed, in our bed

Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say

And I plead and I pray
And I plead and I pray
And I plead and I pray
And I plead and I pray

And I plead and I pray
And I plead and I ray
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
And I plead and I pray
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
And I plead and I pray
Its sacrilege, sacrilege, sacrilege, you say
