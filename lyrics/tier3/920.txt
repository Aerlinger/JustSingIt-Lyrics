A pleasant faced man, steps up to greet you
He smiles and says he's pleased to meet you
Beneath his hat the strangeness lies
Take it off, he's got three eyes

Truth is false and logic lost
Now the fourth dimension is crossed

You have entered the twilight zone
Beyond this world strange things are known
Use the key, unlock the door
See what your fate might have in store

Come explore your dreams' creation
Enter this world of imagination

You wake up, lost in an empty town
Wondering why no one else is around
Look up to see a giant boy
Just become his brand new toy

No escape, no place to hide
Here, where time and space collide

You have entered the twilight zone
Beyond this world strange things are known
Use the key, unlock the door
See what your fate might have in store

Come explore your dreams' creation
Enter this world of imagination
