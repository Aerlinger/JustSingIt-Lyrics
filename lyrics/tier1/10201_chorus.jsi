[:chorus:]
Well, i guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl

Ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Yeah
I don't need no money, fortune or fame
I got all the riches baby, one man can claim

[:chorus:]
Well, i guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl
My girl
