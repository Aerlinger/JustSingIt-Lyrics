22 When the sun goes down18 On my side of town21 That lonesome feelin'16 Comes to my door21 The whole world turns4 Blue0 21 There's a rundown bar25 Across the railroad track21 I gotta table for two11 Way in back17 Where I sit alone23 And think of losin' you0 24 I spend most every night17 Beneath the light14 Of a neon moon0 33 Now if you lose your one and only39 There's always room here for the lonely27 To watch your broken dreams29 Dance in and out of the beams14 Of a neon moon0 27 I think of two young lovers25 Are runnin' wild and free15 I close my eyes17 And sometimes see18 You in the shadows25 Of this smoke filled room0 25 No tellin' how many tears23 I've sat here and cried16 Or how many lies14 That I've lied21 Tellin' my poor heart24 She'll come back someday0 24 Ohh, but I'll be alright24 As long as there's light16 From a neon moon0 34 Ohh, if you lose your one and only39 There's always room here for the lonely27 To watch your broken dreams29 Dance in and out of the beams14 Of a neon moon0 20 The jukebox plays on14 Drink by drink31 And the words of every sad song24 Seem to say what I think25 And its hurt inside of me21 Ain't never gonna end0 24 Ohh, but I'll be alright24 As long as there's light16 From a neon moon0 34 Ohh, if you lose your one and only39 There's always room here for the lonely27 To watch your broken dreams29 Dance in and out of the beams14 Of a neon moon0 28 An' watch your broken dreams29 Dance in and out of the beams14 Of a neon moon0 29 Ohh, watch your broken dreams29 Dance in and out of the beams14 Of a neon moon0 11 Songwriters34 HAMILTON, PAUL / DUNN, RONNIE GENE0 12 Published by* 72 Lyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Group, Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 57 Read more: Brooks & Dunn - Neon Moon Lyrics | MetroLyrics
