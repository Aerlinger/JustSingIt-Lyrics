Soulja Boy Tell 'Em

Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said what's up?
Yeah, I'm getting money, oh

Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said what's up?
Yeah, I'm getting money, oh

Turn my swag on
It's my time to turn it up, yeah, yeah
I put my team on, did my theme song
Now it's time to turn it up, yeah, yeah

I got a question, why they hatin' on me
I got a question, why they hatin' on me
I ain't did nothing to 'em but count this money
And put my team on and now my whole clique stunning

Boy wat's up, yeah? Boy wat's up, yeah?
When I was nine years old
I put it in my head, I'ma die for this gold
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em, boy what's up?

Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said what's up?
Yeah, I'm getting money, oh

Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said what's up?
Yeah, I'm getting money, oh

I'm back again
I know a lot of y'all thought I wasn't coming back, yeah, yeah
I had to prove 'em wrong
Got back in the studio and came up wit' another hit, yeah, yeah

I told the world my story
The world where I'm from
Souljaboyxl.com, boy what's up?
Yeah, yeah

Now every time you see me spit
Every time you hear me rhyme
Every time you see me in your state or town
Say what's up? Yeah, yeah, Soulja Boy Tell 'Em

Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said what's up?
Yeah, I'm getting money, oh

Hopped up out the bed, turn my swag on
Took a look in the mirror said what's up?
Yeah, I'm getting money, oh
