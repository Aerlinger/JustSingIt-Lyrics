Freezin', rests his head on a pillow made of concrete, again
Oh, feelin' maybe he'll see a little better set a days, ooh yeah
Oh hand out faces that he sees time again ain't that familiar, ooh yeah
Oh, dark grin he can't help when he's happy, looks insane, yeah

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know so he chases them away, yeah
Oh, someday, yeah, he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again

Kneeling, looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read
Oh prayin now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feeling understands the weather of the winters on it's way, yeah
Oh, ceilings few and far between all legal halls of shame

Even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know so he chases them away
Oh, someday yeah he'll begin his life again, yeah
Whispering hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away, yeah, yeah

Oh even flow, thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know so he chases them away
Ah, someday yeah he'll begin his life again, yeah
Whispering hands gently lead him away
Him away, him away, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah
