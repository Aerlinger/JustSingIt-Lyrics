Theres a drum line in my heart beat, I know exactly where its from
That turnin' off the street lamps, they say the day is almost done,
Theres a ringing in my ears now, I remember how it was,
The feeling we had last night and it wont stop now because.

Everybody says, hey no, we dont wanna see this day go
If I ever had my say so,
we can make this go all night night night.

Chorus:
Cause if the party is dead, we can bring it back to life,
Yeah, we can make it through the night
If you listen to the words that i say,
cause if the party is dead,
all we need is candle light, and a little bit of dynamite
everybody wont get out of our way.

I got a song stuck in my head,
I know exactly why its there
theres a noise outside my bedroom,
and I dont even care.

If I ever said go home,
everybody here would say hell no
All we gotta do is just let go,
We can make it through the night.

Chorus:
Cause if the party is dead, we can bring it back to life,
Yeah, we can make it through the night
If you listen to the words that i say,
cause if the party is dead,
all we need is candle light, and a little bit of dynamite
everybody wont get out of our way.

Oh oh oh oh..
We can bring it back to life
Yeah, we can bring it back to life.

Cause Im never gonna get this promise out of my head,
And Im never gonna get some sleep inside of my bed,
And Im sorry if goodnight is something Ive ever said..

Chorus:
Cause if the party is dead, we can bring it back to life,
Yeah, we can make it through the night
If you listen to the words that i say,
cause if the party is dead,
all we need is candle light, and a little bit of dynamite
everybody wont get out of our way.

Oh oh oh oh..
We can bring it back to life
Yeah, we can bring it back to life.
