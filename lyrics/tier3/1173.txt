(Everybody on the floor)
East Side
(Everybody on the floor)
South Side
(Everybody on the floor)
North Side
(Everybody on the floor)
West Side
(Everybody on the floor)

We told you we was gonna give it to you raw
(Everybody on the floor)
We ain't do it right the first time
(Everybody on the floor)
We gonna do it right the second time
(Everybody on the floor)

You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cuz you a bug a boo, a bug a boo

I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my E-mails stop
'Cuz you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me and don't you see it ain't cool

Come on, come on, come on
Yo who's buggin' who? Destiny is comin' through
Wyclef, Jerry Wonder 'bout to hit y'all with the new groove

It's not hot that you be callin' me
Stressin' me, pagin' my beeper
You're just non stop and it's not hot
That you be leavin' me messages every 10 minutes

And then you stop by, when I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
'Cuz 20 minutes after I gave you my number
You already had my mailbox full

So what, you're talkin' 'bout your "Feeling you's"
So what, never told you to buy me shoes
So what, now you're rolling with an attitude
Plus the word on the streets is you're a bug a boo

You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cuz you a bug a boo, a bug a boo

I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
'Cuz you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me and don't you see it ain't cool

Come on, come on, come on
Yo who's buggin' who? Destiny is comin' through
Wyclef, Jerry Wonder 'bout to hit y'all with the new groove

It's not hot that when I'm blockin' your phone number
You call me from over your best friend's house
And it's not hot that I can't even go out with my girlfriends
Without you trackin' me down

You need to chill out with that mess
'Cuz you can't keep havin' me stressed
'Cuz every time my phone rings it seems to be you
And I'm prayin' that it is someone else

So what? Ain't even like I knew you
So what? Tell your peoples I ain't feelin' you
So what? Don't call me I'll call you
'Cuz cupid ain't shoot me, he shot you

You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cuz you a bug a boo, a bug a boo

I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
'Cuz you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me and don't you see it ain't cool

Yo, Clef
What up? What up?
We ain't heard from you in a while
So break it down for the cheerin', Latin style

Destiny's Child remade numero uno
You wanna hate me now like Nas
'Cuz you dos, tres, quartro
Thugs still in the dance

Ain't no need to bust you're AK
We all can get along or we can do it Carlito's Way
'Cuz even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I fear no evil, got the Lord present, standin' Eagle

Way before birth I had this whole book memorized
I roll with murderers that just got baptized
I be allowed to see through the eyes of Zion
The New Jerusalem so sing the hook and stop buggin'

You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone poles
Break my lease so I can move
'Cuz you a bug a boo, a bug a boo

I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
'Cuz you a bug a boo
You're buggin' what? You're buggin' who?
You're buggin' me and don't you see it ain't cool

Hey, yo
It's the Refugee Camp
