Lonely
I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody
To call my own

I'm so lonely
I'm Mr. Lonely
I have nobody
For my own
I'm so lonely

Yo, this one here
Goes out to all my playas out there, man, ya know
That got that one good girl, lord
That's always been there man like
Took all the bull****
And then one day she can't take it no more
And decide to leave

Yeah, I woke up in the middle of the night
And I noticed my girl wasn't by my side
Coulda sworn I was dreamin'
For her I was feenin'
So I had to take a little ride

Backtracking on these few years
Tryna figure out what I do to make it go bad
Cuz ever since my girl left me
My whole life came crashin' an' I'm so

Lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
To call my own
(To call my own girl)

I am so lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own girl)
I am so lonely

Can't believe I had a girl like you
And I just let you walk right outta my life
After all I put you through you still
Stuck around and stayed by my side

What really hurt me is I broke your heart, baby
You a good girl and I had no right
I really wanna make things right
Cuz without you in my life girl I'm so

Lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
To call my own
(To call my own girl)

I am so lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own girl)
I am so lonely

Been all about the world ain't never met a girl
That can take the things that you been through
Never thought the day would come
Where you'd get up and run
And I would be out chasing you

Cuz ain't nowhere in the globe I'd rather be
Ain't no one in the globe I'd rather see
Than the girl of my dreams that made me be
So happy but now I'm so lonely

Lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
To call my own
(To call my own no)

I am so lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own girl)
I am so lonely

Never thought that I'd be alone
(Be alone)
I didn't think you'd be gone this long
(Gone so long)
I just want you to call my phone
So stop playing girl and come on home
(Come on home)

Baby girl I didn't mean to shout
I want me and you to work it out
(Work it out baby)
I never wished that I would hurt my baby
(Hurt my baby)
And it's drivin' me crazy cuz I'm so

Lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own girl)

I am so lonely
(So lonely)
I'm Mr. Lonely
(Mr. Lonely)
I have nobody
(I have nobody)
For my own
(To call my own girl)
I am so lonely

So lonely
(Lonely)
So lonely
(So lonely)
Mr. Lonely
(Lonely)

So lonely
(So lonely)
So lonely
(Lonely)

So lonely
(So lonely)
So lonely
Mr. Lonely
