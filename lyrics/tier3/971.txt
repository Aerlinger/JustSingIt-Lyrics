Spent a week in a dusty library
Waiting for some words to jump at me
We met by a trick of fate
French navy, my sailor mate

We met by the moon on a silvery lake
You came my way, said, "I want you to stay"

You and your dietary restrictions
Said you loved me with a lot of convention
I was waiting to be struck by lightning
Waiting for somebody exciting like you

Oh, the thing that you do, you make me go, ooh
With the things that you do, you do, you do

I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it
I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it

I'll be criticized for lending out my eye
I was criticized for letting you break my heart
Why would a stand disappoint unless
Fooling all but I'm more than dead love

Ooh, with the looks, oh tender boy
Ooh, with the looks, the looks, the looks

I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it
I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it, oh

Relationships were something I used to do
Convince me, they are better for me and you
We met by a trick of fate
French navy, my sailor

I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it
I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it

I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it
I wanted to control it
But love, I couldn't hold it, oh, oh
