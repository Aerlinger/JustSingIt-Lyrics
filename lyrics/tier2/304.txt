Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans, jeans
Boots with the fur, with the fur
The whole club was lookin at her
She hit the flo, she hit the flo
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low, low low low low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps, with the straps
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack, ayy!
She hit the flo, she hit the flo
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low, low low low low

I ain't never seen nuthin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Dem birthday cakes, they stole the show

So sexual, she was flexible
Professional, drinkin X and ooo
Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I? Whoa

Did I think I seen shorty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll

I'mma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her more
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes

She had them Apple Bottom jeans, jeans
Boots with the fur, with the fur
The whole club was lookin at her
She hit the flo, she hit the flo
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low, low low low low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps, with the straps
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack, ayy!
She hit the flo, she hit the flo
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low, low low low low

Hey, shawty what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans full of guap
And they ready for Shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan

One stack, come on
Two stacks, come on
Three stacks, come on, now that's three grand
What you think, I'm playin? Baby girl
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands

That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a Soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky on me, I was just like a clover

Shorty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her

Apple Bottom jeans, jeans
Boots with the fur, with the fur
The whole club was lookin at her
She hit the flo, she hit the flo
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low, low low low low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps, with the straps
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack, ayy!
She hit the flo, she hit the flo
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low, low low low low

Whoa, shawty
Yea she was worth the money
Lil mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back

The way she bit that rag
Got her them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that

I was on it, sexy woman, let me shownin
Make me want it two in the mornin
I'm zonin and them rosay bottles foamin

She wouldn't stop, made it drop
Shorty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that guap
Gyal was fly just like my glock

Apple Bottom jeans, jeans
Boots with the fur, with the fur
The whole club was lookin at her
She hit the flo, she hit the flo
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low, low low low low

Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps, with the straps
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack, ayy!
She hit the flo, she hit the flo
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low, low low low low
C'mon
