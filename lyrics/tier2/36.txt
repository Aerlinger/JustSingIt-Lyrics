[Verse 1]:
Saw you leaning against that old record machine.
Saw the name of your band written on the marquee.
Its a full moon tonight
so we gettin rowdy,
Yeah, we gettin rowdy,
get-get-gettin rowdy.

Feeling like Im a high schooler,
Sipping on a warm wine cooler.
Hot cause the party dont stop,
Im in a crop top like Im working at Hooters.
We been keepin it PG,
But I wanna get a little frisky.
Come gimme some of it,
yum like a lollipop,
Let me set you free.

[Chorus]:
Cmon
cause I know what I like,
And youre looking just like my type,
Lets go for it just for tonight,
Cmon, cmon, CMON.

Now dont even try to deny,
Were both going home satisfied,
Lets go for it just for tonight,.
Cmon, cmon, CMON.

[Verse 2]:
Write our names on the wall in the back of the bar.
Steal some bubblegum from the corner meximart.
Yeah, we laughing like kids causing trouble in the dark,
Causing trouble in the dark,
tr-tr-trouble in the dark.

Feeling like a sabertooth tiger,
Sipping on a warm Budweiser.
Touch me and gimme that rush,
Better pack a toothbrush,
gonna pull an all-nighter.
We been keepin it Kosher,
But I wanna get it on fo sure
Come gimme some of that,
yum like a lollipop,
Baby, dont be scared.

[Chorus]:
Cmon
cause I know what I like,
And youre looking just like my type,
Lets go for it just for tonight
Cmon, cmon, CMON.

Now dont even try to deny,
Were both going home satisfied,
Lets go for it just for tonight,
Cmon, cmon, CMON.

[Bridge]:
I dont wanna go to sleep,
I wanna stay up all night,
I wanna just screw around.

I dont wanna think about,
Whats gonna be after this,
I wanna just live right now.

I dont wanna go to sleep,
I wanna stay up all night,
I wanna just screw around.

I dont wanna think about,
Whats gonna be after this,
I wanna just live right now.
CMON!

[Chorus]:
Cmon
cause I know what I like,
And youre looking just like my type,
Lets go for it just for tonight,
Cmon, cmon, CMON.
Now dont even try to deny,
Were both going home satisfied,
Lets go for it just for tonight,
Cmon, cmon, CMON.
