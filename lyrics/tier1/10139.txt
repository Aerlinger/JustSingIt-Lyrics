It's getting so lonely inside this bed
To know if I should lick my wounds
Or say, "Woe is me" instead
And there's an aching inside my head
It's telling me you're better off alone

But after midnight, morning will come
And the day will see if you will get some

They say that girl ya know she act too
Tough tough tough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so
Rough rough rough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light

And I say follow me, follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
'Till you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world
Is quite what it seems

I looked above the other day
'Cos I think I'm good and ready for a change
I live my life by the moon
If it's high, play it low, if it's harvest, go slow
And if it's full, then go

But after midnight, morning will come
And the day will see, if you're gonna get some

They say that girl ya know she act too
Tough tough tough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light
They say that girl you know she act so
Rough rough rough
Well it's till I turn off the light, turn off the light

And I say follow me, follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
'Till you see all my dreams
Not everything in this magical world
Is quite what it seems

And I'm searching for things that I just cannot see
Why don't you, don't you, don't you
Come and be with me?
I pretend to be cool with me, want to believe
That I can do it on my own
Without my heart on my sleeve

I'm running, I'm running, catch up with me, life
Or is it love that I'm looking to find?
It's all in me, can't you see?
Why can't you, why can't you see?
It's all in me, yeah

All in me yeah, where is your logic?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)

And I said follow me, follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
Do you see all my dreams?
(Yea)
Not everything in this magical world
Is quite what it seems

Follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Follow me down, follow me
Down, down, down
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)

And I said follow me, follow me, follow me
Down, down, down, down
(Do you see all my dreams?)
See all my dreams
Follow me follow me follow me
Down down down down
See all my dreams
See all my dreams

Where is your logic?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Where can you turn?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
And where is your logic?
(Turn off the light, turn off the light)
Who do you need?
