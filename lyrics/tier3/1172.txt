You were my sun, you were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance and made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no

All of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head
You should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it, yeah

You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
For you and me, there'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone

But girl I refuse you must have me confused
With some other guy, the bridges were burned
And now it's your turn to cry
Cry me a river

I know that they say
That some things are better left unsaid
But it wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it

All of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head
You should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it, yeah

You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
For you and me, there'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?

You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone

Girl I refuse you must have me confused
With some other guy, the bridges were burned
Now it's your turn to cry
So cry me a river

Go on and just
(Cry me a river, girl)
Go on and just
(Cry me a river)
Baby, go on and just
(Cry me a river, girl)
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, oh
The damage is done
So I guess I be leavin'
Oh, oh
The damage is done
So I guess I be leavin'

Oh, oh
The damage is done
So I guess I be leavin'
Oh, oh
The damage is done
So I guess I be leavin'

You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
For you and me, there'll never be

Don't it make you sad about it
(Cry me a river)
Don't it make you sad about it
(Cry me a river)
Don't it make you sad about it
(Cry me a river)

Cry me a river, oh
Cry me a river, oh
(Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh
(Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh
(Cry me, cry me)

Cry me a river, oh
(Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh
(Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh
(Cry me, cry me)
Cry me a river, oh
(Cry me, cry me)
