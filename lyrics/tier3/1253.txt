One Friday night I took a pill or maybe two,
Down at the car park,
I saw everyone I knew.
And before the night had started,
We had planned to crash a party,
Just a place that someone knew,
A local house belonging to a gangster's crew.

And at the door they shone a light into my face,
Have to admit I felt a little out of place.
But I made my way inside,
Past a thousand crazy eyes,
Then a friend took me aside,
Said ''Everyone here has a knife''.

I've seen it all, I've seen it all now.
I swear to god, I've seen it all,
Nothing shocks me anymore, after tonight.

Those little doves,
That send my mind and heart a-beating.
To say I felt weird really doesn't need repeating,
I could sense the mounting tension,
The atmosphere of violence.
And then they took a guy outside,
And someone stabbed him with a knife.

I've seen it all, I've seen it all now.
I swear to god, I've seen it all,
nothing shocks me anymore after tonight.

I've seen it all, I've seen it all now.
I've seen it all, I've seen it all now.
I swear to god, I've seen it all,
Nothing shocks me anymore, after tonight.

After tonight, I've seen the light,
But not the kind i would have liked.
