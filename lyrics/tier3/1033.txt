Childhood living
Is easy to do
The things that you wanted
Well I bought them for you

Graceless lady
You know who I am
You know I can't let you
Just slide through my hands

And wild horses couldn't drag me away
And wild horses couldn't drag me away

I watched you suffer
A dull aching pain
And now you've decided
To show me the same

No sweeping exits
Or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter
Or treat you unkind

And wild horses couldn't drag me away
And wild horses couldn't drag me away

I know I've dreamt you
A sin and a lie
And I have my freedom
But I don't have much time

Fate has been suffered
And tears must be cried
So let's do some living
After we die

And wild horses couldn't drag me away
And wild horses couldn't drag me away

And wild horses couldn't drag me away
And wild horses couldn't drag me away
No, couldn't drag me away
