Woah, woah

Bang, bang, go the coffin nails
Like a breath exhaled, been gone forever
It seems just like yesterday
How did I miss the red flames?

Raise these back, the days we left
We braved these bitter storms together
Brought to his knees, he cried
But on his feet he died

What God would damn a heart?
And what God drove us apart?
What God could?

Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing

Woah, woah

Bang, bang, from the closet walls
The schoolhouse halls, the shotgun's loaded
Push me and I'll push back
I'm done asking, I demand

From a nation under God
I feel it's love like a cattle prod
Born free but still they hate
Bore me, no, I can't change

It's always darkest just before the dawn
So stay awake with me
Let's prove them wrong

Make it stop, let this end
Eighteen years pushed to the ledge
It's come to this, a weightless step
On the way down singing

Woah, woah

The cold river washed him away
But how could we forget?
Gathering the candles
But not their tongues

And too much blood has flown from the wrist
Of children shamed for those they chose to kiss
Who will rise to stop the blood
We're coming for, insisting on
A different beat, yeah, a brand new song

Woah
A brand new song
Woah, woah, woah

(Woah)
Make it stop, let this end
This life chose me, I'm not lost in sin
(Woah)
And proud I stand, of who I am
I plan to go on living

(Woah)
Make it stop, let this end
Of this years pushed to the land
(Woah)
And proud I stand, of who I am
I plan to go on living
