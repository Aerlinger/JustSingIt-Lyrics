25 Seems like just yesterday21 You were a part of me23 I used to stand so tall22 I used to be so strong25 Your arms around me tight28 Everything, it felt so right40 Unbreakable, like nothin' could go wrong19 Now I can't breathe17 No, I can't sleep21 I'm barely hanging on0 21 Here I am, once again20 I'm torn into pieces28 Can't deny it, can't pretend29 Just thought you were the one22 Broken up, deep inside40 But you won't get to see the tears I cry23 Behind these hazel eyes0 21 I told you everything24 Opened up and let you in24 You made me feel alright19 For once in my life25 Now all that's left of me23 Is what I pretend to be36 So together, but so broken up inside22 'Cause I can't breathe17 No, I can't sleep21 I'm barely hangin' on0 21 Here I am, once again20 I'm torn into pieces28 Can't deny it, can't pretend29 Just thought you were the one22 Broken up, deep inside40 But you won't get to see the tears I cry23 Behind these hazel eyes0 27 Swallow me then spit me out30 For hating you, I blame myself26 Seeing you it kills me now30 No, I don't cry on the outside7 Anymore0 21 Here I am, once again20 I'm torn into pieces28 Can't deny it, can't pretend29 Just thought you were the one22 Broken up, deep inside40 But you won't get to see the tears I cry23 Behind these hazel eyes0 21 Here I am, once again20 I'm torn into pieces28 Can't deny it, can't pretend29 Just thought you were the one22 Broken up, deep inside40 But you won't get to see the tears I cry23 Behind these hazel eyes0 11 Songwriters* 58 SANDBERG, MARTIN KARL / CLARKSON, KELLY / GOTTWALD, LUKASZ0 12 Published by* 63 Lyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Group, EMI Music Publishing0 0 0 * 72 Read more: Kelly Clarkson - Behind These Hazel Eyes Lyrics | MetroLyrics
