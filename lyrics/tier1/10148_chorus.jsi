[:chorus:]
That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late

Too late, oh
I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you
And i need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new, yeah yeah
I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry like the angel, heaven let me think was you
But i'm afraid

[:chorus:]
It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late, whoa whoa
