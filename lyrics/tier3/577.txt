(Intro: August Alsina)
Man I luv this shit
Man I luv this shit
Man I luv this shit
Man I luv this shit
And I luv this shit
And I luv this shit
And I luv this shit

(Verse 1: August Alsina)
It's 2 o'clock and I'm faded
This kush feeling amazing
Got a voicemail on my phone
From a lil' breezy feeling X-rated
She told a nigga she hurtin'
I'm in the car and I'm swervin
I walked into her bedroom
I put it down that's certain
Man I stay on that Ciroc
Man I stay taken shots
May your girl be on my jock

(Bridge: August Alsina)
Maybe because I'm everything your not
See I ain't no bitch nigga no rich nigga
No snitch nigga Ima real nigga that's real nigga
I'm just trying to chill cause
I'm way too drunk to be talking like this
I'm way too had to be trippin like this
I'm way too young to be livin like this
Ask me why I do it?
I'ma put it like this
God Damnit

(Hook: August Alsina)
I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
God damnit I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
So I'ma keep on drinking cause I luv this shit
And Ima keep on smoking cause I luv this shit
And I'ma keep on grindin cause I luv this shit
She tell me keep fuckin cause she luv this shit
And I luv it

(Verse 2: August Alsina)
Rollin through my hood rolling up some good
Shorty be rolling on the wood
Damn she rode it good
Rollin over I ain't sleepin over
Now she rollin the eye
Rollin on the floor laughing
Cause she looks so surprised
Girl, you been around the block
And I been on that Ciroc
Got your man circling the block

(Bridge: August Alsina)
Maybe because I'm everything your not
See I ain't no bitch nigga no rich nigga
No snitch nigga Ima real nigga that's real nigga
I'm just trying to chill cause
I'm way too drunk to be talking like this
I'm way too had to be trippin like this
I'm way too young to be livin like this
Ask me why I do it?
I'ma put it like this
God Damnit

(Hook: August Alsina)
I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
God damnit I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
So I'ma keep on drinking cause I luv this shit
And Ima keep on smoking cause I luv this shit
And I'ma keep on grindin cause I luv this shit
She tell me keep fuckin cause she luv this shit
And I luv it

(Verse 3: Trinidad James)
What you know about love?
Well love know about you
When I try something new
You refuse to believe that my love is true (God damn)
So I use all I got to prove to you
But the proof ain't enough so you move onto the next dude like
What he gon do? (ha! )
I don't understand this girls (girls, girls, girls, girls)
I don't understand this girls (girls, girls, girls, girls)
Looking for a real nigga
Like in all the wrong places
And all the wrong ways
They don't care, they don't change cause
She gon do what she want
And that is okay
And he gon do what he want
And that is okay
I said I luv it, luv it, luv it, luv it (luv it, luv it)
He nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin, nothing about it
Lil bitch

(Hook: August Alsina)
I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
God damnit I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
I luv it, I luv it
So I'ma keep on drinking cause I luv this shit
And Ima keep on smoking cause I luv this shit
And I'ma keep on grindin cause I luv this shit
She tell me keep fuckin cause she luv this shit
And I luv it
