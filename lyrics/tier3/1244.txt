[Dr Dre]
Every morning when I wake up
Uh, money on my mind
Good times and get caked up
Sunshine coming through my blinds, Im living but
Really though, its never enough
10 milly on, thats a must
Living in California, everybody wanna visit for
[Hook]
Women, weed and weather
They come for
women, weed and weather
for the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the
women, weed and weather
women, weed and weather
These niggasll kill for that
Put it in your grill for that
Still everybody gotta build for that
Me, I make mills off that
How the fuck cant yall see I ride
When I drive, down the block and you look outside
H-A-T-E in your eyes
I enter big money for the enterprise
Its a beautiful day I guess
For a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
Roll it up, baby gon lift that dress
Then roll it up for me when Im stressed
[Kendrick Lamar]
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami
Party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, chi town I be really pimpin
But nothing like my hometown Im forever living
[Hook]
Women, weed and weather
They come for
women, weed and weather
for the women, weed and weather
From all around the world for the
women, weed and weather
Got that women, weed and weather
Yo, it sound clever, come and play
Wh-what more can I say
Welcome to LA
[Kendrick Lamar - Verse 2]
My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him some
3Ws only for a three day run
Bitch, take the muthaf-cking panties off you aint no nun, shit
I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
Let it breath
I control, California living til I am old
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
She in the coupe cause she in the neon
Cause she on the BS before we can start
Fuck with a nigga, ride with a nigga
Let em know the priority order me
Hennessy, and for my niggas OG Killa
Call it Jason Vorhees, boy he,
On his job, boy he sure be havin them marks on they marks
Pretty bitches and tyre marks
Let em inhale the pipe exhausts
Let em reveal how much it cost
For this life controlling my vice
No way hell no, uh uh
If Im wrong than I wanna be right
You want to be one, to peak on the chart
Sso the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
Women, weed, weather, its not my fault that its 82 degrees
and my top peeled off
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami
Party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, chi town I be really pimpin
But nothing like my hometown Im forever living
[Hook]
[Dr Dre - Verse 3]
Known for that homegrown where I come from
Smoke one, palm trees
Double Ds got em topless in the sun
I shall proceed, thats me, muthafuck your opinion
How many ways am I killin em
Shit, right around a billion
We on it, that mean we living for the moment
That mean shell fuck til the morning
Time and I got time and I know that Im in a position of controlling anything
I buy that ocean, Imma boss Ill buy that ocean
Aint nobody fucking with this
[Kendrick Lamar]
They want that shit, they off your
I give it to em but in between, my time
I gotta tie shoestrings
Lifes a trip when you want these things
I often slip and then I lean towards 3 Ws and life
You know blow job need an application
Eating pussy make appetite
And yeah my type, I like em brown
Just like my drink, the fuck you think
I dont fuck wit no hand me downs
See if you fuck than its after me
You know how much Imma make it work?
You know her dress, her purse
When you discussed your love for lust
Just make sure you visit here first
Cali
You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
New Orleans and then Miami
Party in New York
Texas I be screwed up, chi town I be really pimpin
But nothing like my hometown Im forever living
[Hook]
