40 She's beautiful in her simple little way* 48 She don't have too much to say when she gets mad* 45 She understands, she don't let go of anything34 Even when the pain gets really bad39 I guess I should've been more like that0 40 You had it all for a pretty little while* 44 And somehow you made me smile when I was sad* 47 You took a chance on a bruised and beaten heart* 45 And then you realized you wanted what you had39 I guess I should've been more like that0 33 I should have held on to my pride31 I should have never let you lie32 I guess you got what you deserve38 I guess I should've been more like her0 * 45 Forgiving you, well, she's stronger than I am* 48 You don't look much like a man from where I'm at* 47 It's plain to see, desperation showed its truth* 46 You love her as she loves you with all she has39 I guess I should've been more like that0 33 I should have held on to my pride31 I should have never let you lie32 I guess you got what you deserve38 I guess I should've been more like her0 40 She's beautiful in her simple little way0 11 Songwriters7 LAMBERT0 12 Published by38 Lyrics Â© Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC0 0 0 * 63 Read more: Miranda Lambert - More Like Her Lyrics | MetroLyrics
