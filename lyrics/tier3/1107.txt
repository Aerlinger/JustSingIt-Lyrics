Dancin', dancin'
Dancin', dancin'
Dancin', dancin'
Dancin'

I feel like the DJ is my bodyguard
You see the way he keeps me safe with the treble and that bass
I feel free enough to party hard
This dress won't go to waste, feels like I own the place

V.I.P to to be the boss
You see the way these people stare, watching how I fling my hair
I'm a dance floor lover
Baby, there's no other who do it like I do it, yeah

From here on out
I'll be your commander
No fear, no doubt
I'll provide the answer

Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander
Now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander
Now I command you to

I-I'll be your commander
I'll provide the answer

Ain't no reason to celebrate
But you know we gon' have a ball, champagne spillin' from the wall
And I'll be partying 'til hella late
But I ain't worried not at all, I just give my driver a call, yeah

Tell him, pick me up at 8am
No we ain't stopping right here, we'll take the party to the crib
Let's go all night, baby
You won't find no lady who does it like I does it, yeah

From here on out
I'll be your commander
No fear, no doubt
I'll provide the answer

Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander
Now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander
Now I command you to

It's jam packed
So DJ where you at?
I know you got my back
So make that bass attack

Let's make these people move
You know I need some room
To do what I do
I'm 'bout to act a fool
(Turn the lights on)

From here on out
I'll be your commander
No fear, no doubt
I'll provide the answer

Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander
Right now I command you to dance
I'll be your commander
Right now I command you to

I-I'll be your commander
I'll provide the answer
