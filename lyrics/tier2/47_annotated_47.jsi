25 Come gather 'round people17 Wherever you roam25 And admit that the waters21 Around you have grown23 And accept it that soon30 You'll be drenched to the bone19 If your time to you15 Is worth savin'30 Then you better start swimmin'27 Or you'll sink like a stone33 For the times they are a-changin'0 * 41 Lyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Group* 47 Writer: PIMENTEL, MIGUEL JONTEL / PEREZ, NATHAN
