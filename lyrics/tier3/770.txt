Was gonna give you these flowers tonight
Was gonna ask you to stay
Practice so that I would say it just right
But now there are no words to say
As I watch you kiss him softly
The same way you kissed me
I scream, what am I gonna do with forever now
Tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?
All the plans we made don't work if you're not around
So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?
What do I do now?
What do I do now?
In slow motion I let these flowers hit the ground
And right before I turn to leave
I watch you kiss him softly
Then look up and see me
And I scream what am I gonna do with forever now
Tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?
All the plans we made don't work if you're not around
So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?
What do I do now?
Everything you said we would be
All the things you said we'd do
I revolve my life around the thought of me and you
And I scream what am I gonna do with forever now
What do I do? What do I do now?
Tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?
What do I do? What do I do now?
All the plans we made don't work if you're not around
So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?
What do I do now?
What do I do now?
What do I do now?
What do I do? What do I do now?
What do I do now?
What do I do? What do I do now?
What do I do now?
