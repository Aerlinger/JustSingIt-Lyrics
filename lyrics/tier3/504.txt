Theres always that one person that will always have your heart
You'll never see it coming 'cause youre blinded from the start
Know that youre that one for me, its clear for everyone to see
Ooh, baby, aw, you'll always be my boo

See, I dont know about yall but I know about us and uh
Its the only way we know how to rock
I dont know about yall but I know about us and uh
Its the only way we know how to rock

Do you remember, girl
I was the one who gave you your first kiss
'Cause I remember, girl
I was the one who said put your lips like this
Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
Girl, I was there and you were my baby

It started when we were younger you were mine
(My boo)
Now another brother's taken over but its still in your eyes
(My boo)
Even though we use to argue, its all right
(My boo)
I know we havent seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo

I was in love with you, when we were younger you were mine
(My boo)
When I see you from time to time I still feel like
(My boo)
You can see it no matter how I try to hide
(My boo)
And even though theres another man whos in my life
You will always be my boo

Yes, I remember, boy, 'cause after we kissed
I can only think about your lips
Yes, I remember, boy, the moment I knew
You were the one I could spend my life with
Even before all the fame and people screamin' your name
I was there and you were my baby

It started when we were younger you were mine
(My boo)
Now another brother's taken over but its still in your eyes
(My boo)
Even though we use to argue, its all right
(My boo)
I know we havent seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo

I was in love with you when we were younger you were mine
(My boo)
When I see you from time to time I still feel like
(My boo)
You can see it no matter how I try to hide
(My boo)
And even though theres another man whos in my life
(What we have is in each other)
You will always be my boo

My, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my, my boo
My, oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my boo

It started when we were younger you were mine
(My boo)
Now another brother's taken over but its still in your eyes
(My boo)
Even though we use to argue, its all right
(My boo)
I know we havent seen each other in a while
But you will always be my boo
(Uh uh)

I dont know about yall but I know about us and uh
Its the only way we know how to rock
I dont know about yall but I know about us and uh
It's the only way we know how to rock
