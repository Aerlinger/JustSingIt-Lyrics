A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I can give you life, I can take it away
A heart of stone, a smoking gun
I'm working it out, I'm working

Feel so underrated
Why'd you feel so negated?

Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into my soul
I wanted to bite, not destroy, to feel her underneath
Turning into the light

She don't think straight
No no no, she don't think straight

She got such a dirty mind and it never ever stops
And you don't taste like her and you never ever will
And we don't read the papers, we don't read the news
Heaven's never enough, we will never be fooled

Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into my soul
I wanted to bite, not destroy, to feel her underneath
Turning into the light

Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into my soul
I wanted to bite, not destroy, to feel her underneath
Turning into the light

And if you feel a little left behind
We will wait for you on the other side

And if you feel a little left behind
We will wait for you on the other side

Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into my soul
I wanted to bite, not destroy, to feel her underneath
Turning into the light

Turning away from the light, becoming adult
Turning into my soul
I wanted to bite, not destroy, to feel her underneath
Turning into the light
