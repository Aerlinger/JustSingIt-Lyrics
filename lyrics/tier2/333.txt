Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the
(Get, get like me)
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the
(Get like me)

Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
Put it in the air
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
Put it in the air

Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
Put it in the air
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit

I got a chip in my engine, 26 inch rims
Got fade away money, ***** I'm ballin out the gym
Got my old school pumpin, hit wheel on recline
If you think a ***** broke, you out yo' monkey *** mind

Diamonds on my pinky, hand on the pine
Touch and die, yo mama do the second line
Screens fallin from the sky, fallin in my cup
Old school Chevy thang, comin down, ***** what

Got diamonds in my mouth, got some Gucci on my seat
Got g's on my ***, it's cold when I speak
Got a freak on my arm, got a charm around my neck
You can go on and pass the mike, watch I'm 'bout to catch wreck

Still screamin out mayne, ***** in my hand
Southside so throwed, throwed in the game
Big face on my chain, 84's on the frame
Big bodies comin down, hoggin up both lanes

Stuntin, stuntin is a habit, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the
(Get, get like me)
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the
(Get like me)

Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
Put it in the air
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
Put it in the air

Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
Put it in the air
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit

The name you know of
A little bit of change now your boy done blown up
And Im doing things that gets exposed
Stuntin aint a thing to me
And its obvious its plain to see

That you are going to make us both, get into some things
Thatll scare grown folks, they might even say
You should leave me alone, dont be scared
You need to get like me

Stuntin is a habit, just gotta have it
Shawty can throw anything at me
Im gonna bag it, when she sees the carrots
They real just like a rabbit, cant no other boy
Do the things you like

He aint your type, to change your life
But if you did your homework
Girl Im pretty sure you know what I got
Drop top, singing know Jones and Banner gonna roll
Let me stop

Stuntin is a habit, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the
(Get, get like me)
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the
(Get like me)

Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
Put it in the air
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
Put it in the air

Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
Put it in the air
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit

Look at whos the boys ridin Maybach
Im in the candy, laid back, like I slang *****
My moneys stacked to the ceiling
Getting in my Chevys like climbing up a building

Them 28s on deck, 37 on my wrist, 105 on my neck
This rap moneys ok, want you to see these movies checks
And its cartoon path to SS so sweet
My Bentleys hatin on that ***, while old schoolers gettin *****

She opened up her arm, but then she slit both wrists
They go to suicide doors, wood on the dash
Bare steels on the toes, I got [incomprehensible]
Got some chrome on the nose, the white boys go sweet

The black folks go ohh!, I got a lac full of ****
Im brick with the *****, Im throwin bombs out the Lambo
Them butterflies throwin up, I got Chad in my heart
And DJ Screwed in my crunk

Stuntin, stuntin is a habit, get like me
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the
(Get, get like me)
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the
(Get like me)

Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
Put it in the air
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
Put it in the air

Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
Put it in the air
Have you ever seen a Chevy with the butterfly doors?
Stuntin, stuntin is a habit
