You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't get enough that day
I'm thinking of that day
You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't get enough that day
I'm thinking of that day

Picked me out a rose, stands by her man
She wants to party, she loves to dance
Won't raise me voice, won't raise my hand
Keep telling your story, I'll understand

You can have my body
You can have my money
You can have my soul if you want it too
You've become a problem
But I don't want to solve it
'Cause I can't get over you

You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't get enough that day
I'm thinking of that day
You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't get enough that day
I'm thinking of that day

Took a lot of time
See through my disguise
Reverse the current, electrified
Kick me to the curb, I keep hanging on
You make me weak, but you make me strong

You can have my body
You can have my money
You can have my soul if you want it too
You've become a problem
But I don't want to solve it
'Cause I can't get over you

Schnabel on the walls
G Clooney villas
Rose waterfalls
Days in Marbella
Nights Porto Banus
The world is mine as long as I'm with you

Ooh la la
Ooh la la
Ooh la la
Ooh la la

You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't get enough that day
I'm thinking of that day
You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't get enough that day
I'm thinking of that day

You can have my body
You can have my money
You can have my soul if you want it too
You've become a problem
But I don't want to solve it
'Cause I can't get over you

You can have my body
You can have my money
You can have my soul if you want it too
You've become a problem
But I don't want to solve it
'Cause I can't get over you

You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't get enough that day
I'm thinking of that day
You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't get enough that day
I'm thinking of that day

You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't get enough that day
I'm thinking of that day
You gave me some that day
I fell in love that day
Can't get enough that day
I'm thinking of that day

Ooh la la
Ooh la la
Ooh la la
Ooh la la
