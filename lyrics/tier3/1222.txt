[Tyga]
Young Nino, f-ck a b-tch in a peacoat
Carlito, scarface, al pacino
Bun-B though, pimp c, r.i.p though
I goes deep in that p-ssy, Dan Marino
She wanna be the one, f-ck her to my own single
Break a b-tch heart, no future miss cleo
Snap back, a-a-automatic reload
Flyer than a f-ck-ng beatle, you can't beat 'em
Vampire f-ck up your evening
I pop up and eat lunch, leave you in the cement
Don't believe it, stripe like a f-ck-ng didas
The gun selena, give a n-gga bieber fever
Real f-ck-ng hot, put it in park
Take a shot, higher than a tube sock
You a bop, give me top top, as I load the guap
Man these n-ggas say i'm fly but to her i'm god
[Hook]
I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded
And I don't give a f-ck
[Tyga]
F-ck is up, n-gga's stomping in my chucks
yeah I make it rain, dear, cause i'm all by my bucks
Use the butt up in the front, d-ck up in her cunt
And I put it in her hole, hole in one, putt putt
AHHHHHH
S-Super McNasty, why you McLoving
When the b-tch call me daddy
Pimp no caddy, she wish she never had me
Treat her like a dog, called the b-tch lassy
Young savvy, bang her like cincinatti
Above average, f-fly like i'm aladdin
They bend backwards, throw the p-ssy at them
I'm ben wallace, dunk up in your basket
Balls in the air, no games,
I'm serious, double dare
There's too many b-tches,
Why these n-ggas wanna stare
Patron up in here
N-gga this ain't no beer
[Hook]
I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded
And I don't give a f-ck
[Lil' Wayne]
Mama, there go that monster
Abracadabra, magic johnson
My motherf-ck-ng doctor
Said I need a doctor
So I called house,
Now I am a pill popper
Faded like skinnys
Young Money we winning
I told her if I change
She won't get a penny
Milking that sh-t, pregnant b-tch tities
Bringing home the bacon
I'm f-ck-ng miss piggy
Loaded like a semi, send me naked pictures
She knows my d-ck, she call that n-gga Richard
Prior to me cumming, I had to stick thumb in, her ass
one time, smell my finger make you vomit
Flyer than a hornet, the shoe fit I worn it
She tried to j-ck me off, can't beat it, join it
Tunechi, punechi, ever she call it,
Flag scarlett, I killed it, mourn it
[Hook]
Faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded faded
My n-gga I'm faded faded
And I don't give a f-ck
