40 I remember trying not to stare the night* 43 That I first met you, you had me mesmerized* 46 And three weeks later in the front porch light40 Taking 45 minutes just to kiss goodnight* 52 I hadn't told you yet but I thought I loved you then0 * 55 But now you're my whole life, now you're my whole world* 54 And I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl* 56 Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been* 63 We've come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then0 * 61 And I remember taking you back to right where I first met you21 You were so surprised* 42 There were people around but I didn't care34 I got down on one knee right there* 41 And once again I thought I loved you then0 * 55 But now you're my whole life, now you're my whole world* 54 And I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl* 56 Like a river meets the sea, stronger than it's ever been* 63 We've come so far since that day and I thought I loved you then0 * 41 I can just see you with a baby on the way* 49 I can just see you when your hair is turning gray* 52 What I can't see is how I'm ever gonna love you more25 But I've said that before0 * 55 And now you're my whole life, now you're my whole world* 50 I just can't believe the way I feel about you girl* 52 We'll look back someday at this moment that we're in* 61 And I'll look at you and say, "And I thought I loved you then31 And I thought I loved you then"0 11 Songwriters* 54 GORLEY, ASHLEY / DUBOIS, CHRIS / PAISLEY, BRAD DOUGLAS0 12 Published by* 60 Lyrics Â© Warner/Chappell Music, Inc., WINDSWEPT HOLDINGS LLC0 0 0 * 51 Read more: Brad Paisley - Then Lyrics | MetroLyrics
