You come out in night
That's when the energy comes
And the dark side's light
And the vampires roam
Struts your rasta wear
And your suicide poem
And a cross from a faith
That died before Jesus came
You're building a mystery

You live in a church
Where you sleep with voodoo dolls
And you won't give up the search
For the ghosts in the halls
Wear sandals in snow and
A smile that won't wash away
Can you look at the window
Without your shadow getting in the way

(Ooh)
You're so beautiful
With an edge and a charm
You're so careful
When I'm in your arms

'Cause you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on, holding it in
Oh yeah, you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully

You woke up screaming aloud
A prayer from your secret God
To feed off our fears
And hold back your tears
Oh you give us a tantrum
And a know-it-all grin
Just when we need one
When the evening's thin

Oh you're so beautiful
A beautiful fucked up man
You're setting up your
Razor wire shrine

'Cause you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on, holding it in
Oh yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully

Ooh you're working
You're building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in
Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully

Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
Holding on and holding it in
Yeah you're working
Building a mystery
And choosing so carefully
You're building a mystery
