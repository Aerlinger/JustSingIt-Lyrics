I, I, I, I, I, I, I could pay for everything that's on you.
So everything is on me
Got them girls going Cindy Lauper, Gaga and a little Blondie
If you ain't drunk, then you're in the wrong club
Don't feel sexy, you're on the wrong beach
Tell the bar that we dont want no glass just bottles and I'm buying everybody one each
Yeah so bring the Veuve cliquot,
D about to hit the big 3 0
Party like its Carnival in Rio,
Lifes too short, Danny devito
Yo, we live, we die, we give, we try, we kiss, we fly
Also we can have a good time

Im in here busy looking for the next top model
Whos wearing something new and something old and something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow,
Tonight, were drinking from the bottle!

[Beat Break]

Were drinking from the bottle!

Yo as long as they ain't gettin' it wrong (yeah)
Then everything is alright
Got them girls going Heidi Klum, the Kardashians, Rihanna all types
If you ain't lean then you're the wrong scene
If you ain't high then you're not in my vibe
Tell the bar that we don't need no sparklers or nothing just keep the bottles coming all night
Yeah so bring the Veuve Clicquot,
D about to hit the big 3 0
Party like its Carnival in Rio
Lifes too short, Danny devito
Yo, we live, we die, we give, we try, we kiss, we fly
Also we can have a good time

Im in here busy looking for the next top model
Whos wearing something new and something old and something borrowed
I know this crazy life can be a bitter pill to swallow
So forget about tomorrow,
Tonight, were drinking from the bottle!

[Beat Break]

Were drinking from the bottle!

Im in here busy looking for the next top model
Im in here busy looking for the next top model
Im in here busy looking for the next top model
Im in here busy looking for the next top model
The next top model
The next top model
I'm in here busy looking for the next top model
The next top model
The next top model
The next top, next top

Tonight we're drinking from the bottle

[Beat Break]

We're drinking from the bottle
