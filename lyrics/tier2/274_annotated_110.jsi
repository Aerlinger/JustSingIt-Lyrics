* 53 I remembered black skies, the lightning all around me* 45 I remembered each flash as time began to blur* 52 Like a startling sign that fate had finally found me* 56 And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve0 * 62 So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean* 46 Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes* 59 Give me reason to fill this hole, connect the space between* 68 Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new divide0 * 54 There was nothing in sight but memories left abandoned* 51 There was nowhere to hide, the ashes fell like snow* 54 And the ground caved in between where we were standing* 56 And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve0 * 62 So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean* 69 Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes across this new divide0 * 59 In every loss, in every lie, in every truth that you'd deny* 64 And each regret and each goodbye was a mistake too great to hide* 56 And your voice was all I heard that I get what I deserve0 * 62 So give me reason to prove me wrong, to wash this memory clean* 46 Let the floods cross the distance in your eyes* 59 Give me reason to fill this hole, connect the space between* 68 Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies across this new divide* 46 Across this new divide, across this new divide0 11 Songwriters* 110 BENNINGTON, CHESTER CHARLES / BOURDON, ROBERT G. / DELSON, BRAD / SHINODA, MIKE / FARRELL, DAVE / HAHN, JOSEPH0 12 Published by* 41 Lyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Group0 0 0 * 56 Read more: Linkin Park - New Divide Lyrics | MetroLyrics
