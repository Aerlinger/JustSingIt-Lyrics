Last night she said
Oh baby I feel so down
Til' you turn me off
When I feel left out

So I, I turned round
Oh baby don't care no more
I know this for sure
I'm walking out that door

Well I've been in town for just about fifteen, oh minutes now
And baby I feel so down
See I don't know why
I was walking for miles

And people they don't understand
No girlfriends they won't understand
Your grandsons they won't understand
And me I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night she said
Oh baby don't feel so down
Til' you turn me off
When I feel left out

So I, I turned round,
Oh baby gonna be just fine
It was a great big lie
'Cause I left that night

And people they don't understand
No girlfriends they won't understand
In spaceships they won't understand
And me I ain't ever gonna understand

Last night she said
Oh baby don't feel so down
Til' you turn me off
When I feel left out

So I, I turned round
Oh baby I don't care no more
I know it's for sure
I'm walking out that door, yeah
