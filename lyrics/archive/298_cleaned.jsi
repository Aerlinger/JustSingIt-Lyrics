She got eyes that cut you like a knife
And lips that taste like sweet red wine
And pretty legs go to heaven every time
She got a gentle way that puts me at ease
When she walks in the room, I can hardly breathe
Got a devastating smile, knock a grown man to his knees
She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
And every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is
You know I've never been the type that would ever want to stay
Bring 'em home at night and they're gone the next day
But that all changed when she walked into my life
And people askinâ€™ why it is
I tell them I don't know
Just something about the woman makes my heart go haywire
And she's gonna be my wife
She got whatever it is
It blows me away
She's everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
She got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you"
You got whatever it is
Now when she loves me
Girl, that's how I feel
When she loves me, I'm on top of the world
When she loves me, I can live forever
When she loves me, I am untouchable
You got whatever it is
It blows me away
You're everything I wanted to say to a woman
But couldn't find the words to say
You got whatever it is
I don't know what to do
Every time I try and tell her how I feel
It comes out "I love you, I do"
You got whatever it is
Oh, you got whatever it is
