I've been standing where you left me (left me)
Praying that you'd come and get me (get me)
But now I've found my second wind (wind)
Now I found my second skin (skin)

Well I know what you were thinking
You thought you'd watch me fade away (away)
When you broke me into pieces
But I gave each piece a name (a name)

One of me is wiser
One of me is stronger
One of me's a fighter
And there's a thousand faces of me
And we're gonna rise up
Yeah, we're gonna rise up
For every time you broke me
And you're gonna face an army
Army of me

Welcome to my revolution (lution) ha
All your walls are breaking down (down) mmmhmmm
It's time you had a taste of losing (losing) nah
Time the table's turned around (round) yeah

I see a glimpse of recognition
But it's too little it's too late, it's too late
And what you though was your best decision, ugh
Just became your worst mistake (mistake)

One of me is wiser
One of me is stronger
One of me's a fighter
And there's a thousand faces of me
And we're gonna rise up
Yeah, we're gonna rise up
For every time you broke me
And you're gonna face an army
Army of me

So how does it feel
To know that I beat ya
And I can defeat ya
Oh how does it feel
Cause it sure feels sweeter
It sure feels sweeter to me

Now that that I am wiser
Now that I am stronger
Now that I'm a fighter, ha
There's a thousand faces of me

And I'm gonna rise up (I'm gonna rise up)
Yeah I'm gonna rise up (yeah I'm gonna rise up)
For every time you broke me (you broke me, yeah ay)
There's a thousand faces of me (ay ay)
And I'm gonna rise up (rise up)
Yeah and I'm gonna rise up (rise up)
For every time you broke me (for every time you broke me, yay)
You're gonna face an army
Army of me
