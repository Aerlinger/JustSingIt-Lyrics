Verse 1- lil Wayne

I tell her, now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga,
I already know that life is deep but I still dig her.
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less,
I'm in hells kitchen with an apron and a hair net.
Devil on my shoulders, the lord is my wittness,
So on my libra scale I'm weighing sins and forgiveness.
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop,
Karma is a bitch, well just make sure that bitch is beautiful.
Life on the edge, I'm dangling my feet,
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me.
Haters can't see me, nose bleed seats,
And today I went shopping, and talk is still cheap.
I rock to the beat of my drum set,
I've been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet.
( haha )
but I'm, Ray Charles to the bull shit,
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split.

Chorus 1- Drake

Uhhhh,
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back and told me baby it's real,
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel.
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal,
Cuz she bad, so maybe she won't,
But sh*t, then again maybe she will.
( yeah )
Do it for the realist niggas in the fucking game right now, she will.
( yeah )
Do it for the realist niggas in the fucking game right now, she will, she will, she will.
( uhh )
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now, she will, she will, she will.
( uhh )
Do it for the realist niggas in the fucking game right now, she will, she will, she will....

Verse 2- lil Wayne

I tell her, now go and pop that pussy for me,
Haters can't see me but them bitches still looking for me.
And you can take that to the bank and deposit that,
Put your 2 cents in, and get a dollah' back.
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack,
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back.
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine.
Eat her till she cry, call that wine n dine.
Try to check me and imma have them checking pulses,
They say chose wisely, that's why I was chosen.
Rocking like asphalt, it's the cash fault,
Looked in the face of death, and took his mask off.
Now I like my house big and my grass soft,
I like my girl face south and her ass north.
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bill shit,
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split.

Verse 2- Drake

Uhhhh,
She just started to pop it for a nigga and looked back and told me baby it's real,
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second, I squeeze it and I can tell how it feel.
I wish we could take of and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal,
Cuz she bad, so maybe she won't,
But shit, then again maybe she will.
( yeah )
Do it for the realist niggas in the fucking game right now, she will.
( yeah )
Do it for the realist niggas in the fucking game right now, she will, she will, she will.
( uhh )
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now, she will, she will, she will.
( uhh )
Do it for the realist niggas in the fucking game right now, she will, she will, she will....

Lil Wayne- " ladies and gentlemen, Drizzy! "

Chorus 3- Drake
