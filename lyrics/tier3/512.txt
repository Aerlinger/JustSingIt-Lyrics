Bring em out, bring em out
Bring em out, bring em out
It's hard to yell when the barrels in ya mouth

Bring em out, bring em out
Bring em out, bring em out
Bring em out, bring em out
Bring em out, bring em out

T.I.P comin' live from the V.I.P
Heard the night life lost life like what I need
Both the Feds and the State wanna see bout me
The whole city got bizzerk, he got treat

Anotha nigga got a hit but shawty, he not me
Who set the city on fire as soon as he got freed?
Da King, back now, hoes don't even know how to act, now
Hit the club, strippers getting naked 'fore I sit down

Still ballin' money, stack tall as Shaq, now
Still push a button to let the roof on the 'Lac down
I'm on the road doin' shows, puttin' my mack down
Mississippi to Philly Albuquerque to Chatt Town

I got the crowd yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)
All my hot girls yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)

All the Dope Boyz yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)
From the back they yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)

Yeah, what other rap nigga hooder than this
I got rich and I'm still on some hoolagin' shit
You be rappin' 'bout blow I was movin' the shit
Talkin' 'bout shootin' out and I was doin' the shit

If I hit you in the face, you gon' be suin' and shit
And if I catch anotha case, I know I'll truly be missed
So I'ma keep it cool head, stay out of the news
Headlines and shows other rappers it's bedtime

It's clear to see that I'm ahead of my time
I copped a chromed out hard top Carrerra to shine
I got some time, it ain't shit 'cause I get better wit time
Who got a flow and a live show better than mine?

I got a packed house yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)
All my hot girls yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)

All the Dope Boyz yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)
From the back they yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)

Mic check 1-2, 1-2, you wanna beef
Wit the King, what's is you gon' do?
Will you show up on the scene wit 2 guns drew?
Or you and ya friend play a little two on two?

If You knew half of what I knew
you'd be hittin' the deck
I got a tool and a vest I can get some respect
I'ma make it hard for a sucka nigga to flex
Sho 'em this ain't the squad for a nigga to test

Pimp, my nutz too large and we way too fresh
Work well wit Nines, AK's and Techs
And quick to check a lame like a game of chess
You want beef, nigga, bring ya best and we'll be standin'

In ya front yard yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)
All my hot girls yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)

All the Dope Boyz yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)
From the back they yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)

In ya front yard yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)
All my hot girls yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)

All the Dope Boyz yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)
From the back they yellin'
(Bring em out, bring em out)

Hands in the air, now
Hands in the air, now
Hands, hands in the, in the air, air, now
Hands in the air, now

Hands in the air, now
Hands in the air, now
Hands, hands in the, in the air, air, now
Put ya hands in the air, now

(I can't hear you)
Bring em out, bring em out
Bring em out, bring em out

(I can't hear you)
Bring em out, bring em out
Bring em out, bring em out

(I can't hear you)
Bring em out, bring em out
Bring em out, bring em out

(I can't hear you)
Bring em out, bring em out
Bring em out, bring em out

Bring em out, bring em out
Bring em out, bring em out
Bring em out, bring em out
Bring em out, bring em out
