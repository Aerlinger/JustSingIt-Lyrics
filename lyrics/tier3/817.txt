[Hook]
I gotta grind, wont stop
Hustle wont quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other shit
I got a high price lifestyle super bad bitch
If I want it, then I got it
If I dont then all I gotta do is
Go, get it, stay about my bidness
Ball till I fall, floss until I finish
I can go, get it, stay about my bidness
Im living just to kill it, stacking million to the ceiling
[Verse 1]
Eveyday above ground all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louie down to the drawers, Lou Vuitton kicks
Got a mad hatter swagger, bitch Im stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they stupid dumb thick
Im the marathon man, all I do is run shit
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multimillion dollar shit
Money is the object, hot shit
Bitch I got a sauna on my arm
See bigger with no diamond
They just talk about they got it,
Im the upper echelon, though
Bitch Im bout that action, you could gone with that convo
I done more than you dream bout
your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
With a bad crew, the whole team high
Go on boy, get seen bout, bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough, thats all I see
I g.o.g.e.t.i.t.
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I live life, up late night
Get shit faced when I take flight
I get paid, no sick days
My outfits on switch blade
Dont sniff yay, but I blow dro
Bank roll on loco
Still ride with that 44
Dont let my P-O know
Bad white bitch super thick
Im Ice T, she Coco
She got another bitch, and another bitch
Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper trail
No phone call, no emails, no photos
Just backshot, with that fat butt
And low blow headbutts in slow-mo
Purple label polo and akoo,thats what I do
Man I strive and roll my denim in my new Margiella shoes
Man, we be cool if we just parle
On Margharita Molly and the strong?
We menagin for a hobby
We kick it how we kick it
Know you envy how Im living
Just cant resist the
Get the million bout my business
Bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough thats all I see
I g.o.g.e.t.i.t.
[Hook]
