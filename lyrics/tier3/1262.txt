Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I've seen those English dramas, too, they're cruel
So if there's any other way to spell the word
It's fine with me, with me

Why would you speak to me that way?
Especially when I always said
That I haven't got the words for you
All your diction, dripping with disdain
Through the pain, I always tell the truth

Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I climbed to Dharamshala too, I did
I met the highest lama
His accent sounded fine to me, to me

Check your handbook, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys

Why would you lie about how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie about anything at all?
First the window, then it's through the wall
Lil' Jon, he always tells the truth

Check your passport, it's no trick
Take the chapstick, put it on your lips
Crack a smile, adjust my tie
Know your butler, unlike other guys

Why would you lie about how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie about anything at all?
First the window, then it's through the wall

Why would you tape my conversations?
Show your paintings at the United Nations
Lil' Jon, he always tells the truth
