* 51 She had a shiny little Beemer with the rag top down* 45 Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out* 44 The dogs were all barkin' and waggin' around40 And I just laughed and said y'all get in0 * 46 She had on a new dress and she curled her hair* 44 She was looking too good not to go somewhere* 45 Said "what you want to do, baby, I don't care* 44 We can go to the show, we can stay out here"0 * 53 And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor35 We can go slow or make it go faster* 45 Down through the woods and out to the pasture* 44 'Long as I'm with you it really don't matter0 * 43 Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to39 Girl, you know you got me to hold on to* 43 We can go to town, but baby if you'd rather* 48 I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor0 * 48 Said we can fire it up and I can show you around* 44 Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down* 53 When the fireflies are dancing and the moon comes out* 52 We can turn on the lights and head back to the house0 * 51 Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor35 We can go slow or make it go faster* 45 Down through the woods and out to the pasture* 44 'Long as I'm with you it really don't matter0 * 43 Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to39 Girl, you know you got me to hold on to* 43 We can go to town, but baby if you'd rather* 48 I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor0 29 Just let me dust off the seat* 42 Mmm, put your pretty little arms around me9 @#$% yeah0 * 51 You can climb up in my lap and drive if you want to39 Girl, you know you got me to hold on to* 43 We can go to town, but baby if you'd rather* 48 I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor0 13 Oh yeah, yeah17 We can go to town23 We can go another round23 On my big green tractor0 11 Songwriters29 DAVID LEE MURPHY, JIM COLLINS0 12 Published by34 Lyrics Â© CAL IV ENTERTAINMENT, LLC0 0 0 * 64 Read more: Jason Aldean - Big Green Tractor Lyrics | MetroLyrics
