Yeah,
So come on and chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Check

You better check yo self before you wreck yo self
'Cos I'm bad for your health I come real stealth
Droppin' bombs on ya moms fuck car alarms
Doin' foul crime, I'm that nigga wit'cha Alpine

Sold it for a six-o, always let tricks know
And friends know, we got the indo
No I'm not a sucker, sittin' in a house of pain
And no I'm not the butler, I'll cut ya

Head butt ya, you say you can't touch this
And I wouldn't touch ya, in fact motherfuck ya
Here to let you know boy, oh boy
I make dough but don't call me Dough Boy

This ain't no fuckin' motion picture
A guy or bitch-a, I'll get wit'cha
And hit ya, takin' that yack to the neck
So you better run a check

So come on and chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Yeah, come on and check yo self before you wreck yo self
'Cause shotgun bullets are bad for your health

Chickity-check
Chickity-check

Tricks wanna step to Cube and then they get played
'Cause they bitch may pullin' out a switchblade
That's kinda trifle, 'cause that's a knife-o
AK-47, assault rifle

Hold the fifty, I'm nifty, pow
I gotta new style, watch out now
I hate motherfuckers claimin' that they foldin' bank
But steady talkin' shit in the holding tank

First you wanna step to me
Now your ass screamin' for the deputy
They send you to Charlie-Baker-Denver row
Now they runnin' up in ya slow

You're gone, used to be the Don Juan
Now your name is just Twan
Switch it, snap it, rollin' your eyes and neck
You better run a check

So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
'Cause big dicks up yo ass is bad for yo health

Chickity-check
Chickity-check

If you're foul, you better run a make on that license plate
You coulda had a V8
Instead of a tre-eight slug to the cranium
I got six and I'm aimin' 'em

Will I shoot or keep you guessin'
And fuck you and that shit ya stressin'
Bitch, get off the wood, you're no good
There goes the neighborhood hooker

Go ahead and keep your drawers
Givin up the claps and who needs applause
At a time like this, pop the coochie and ya dead
The bitch is a Miami Hurricane hit

Sprung, niggaz call her 'Lips and Lungs'
Nappy dugout, get the fuck out
'Cause women like you gets no respect
Bitch, you better run a check

So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity wreck yo self
'Cause bitches like you is bad for my health

Chickity check
Chickity check

So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity wreck yo self

So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
So chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self
Come on and check yo self before you wrickity wreck yo self
