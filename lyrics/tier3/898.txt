dance baby dance like the world is ending
dance baby dance like the world is ending
dance baby dance cuz the world is ending
[x4]

this is who you are
[x6]

ohh, ohh,

sit back and look for the warnings
the future's bright and alarming
sit back and look for the warnings
[x2]

Cool

Woo

Huh

Cool

Oh

they be walking around ya
with your head cut off
[x4]

their power's fear and it surrounds me
there are signs you can see
one day we will wake the walking zombies
til then we pray

everybody, everybody

the king and his ghost are laughing at me
these signs you can see
one day we will listen for the sirens
'til then we pray

Skeletons march
A army guns
Drop your feet
I'm scared
I'm duke Ellington
My mother said there'd by things like this
But one of the fires lit made her piss

Crawling are zombies all up inside me
Transforming vampires right beside me
And you can't run
Cuz you did, you'd be dead
And the walls can't roll from the side of my head

I beat the drool
I beat the ghouls
But his last kiss all suckers
They will cease to exist
I can't entertain what it'd be to be human
Lay waste to cities leave towns in ruin
I. Am. A. Ro. Bot.

Whole arsenal stock ready to blow
Lastly, you see my by 3 by 3
Firing these things called TNT

These things called TNT
These things called TNT
They call me TNT
These things called TNT

Ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

Aw,
We can dance like the world's over
Yeah it's almost 2012 call your girls over
Let's kick back, pop shots, have a ball
And if the world blow up, next life we'll do it all over

Ah Yeah,
Let's toast to the memory
I wrote my name in the sky
So remember me
Baby forever we
Together we'll ........
I'll leave my baby over something
Then hell'll freeze
Froze.
This world cold like Natalie
So
Let's lose our clothes like Adam, Eve
Back to the basics
Step out the matrix
Step out your cool baby
Get on my spaceship

I've seen her face lit
She seen the sound like a basin
So ran home like a base hit
Safe!
Life is whatever you think it is
So whatchoo think this is?

Oh, ah, ah
Oh, ah, ah

Aw
Yeah it's all in your mind baby
You gotta do what you feel like, apply baby
You gotta spread your wings and just fly baby
You feel like you're reborn?
That's my baby
Says she feel it in her soul like a vibrator
I got some things for your thoughts
We can try later
Let's hit the dancefloor
Right before we outa town
And just party like it's 1999

You know what prince said
Girl, you my princess
I got the glass slipper
I hope the thing fit

Your body on fire
Let me extinguish
hop on this white horse
Ride to the sunset

Is anybody really out there breathing?
Is anybody really sick of bleeding
So come out scream to the sky this evening
It's full of women
I'm a choice you're feeling

Let's stop today!
Let's stop today!
x2

Stop today x2

The queens heart
The knights of shame
The people's voice
So we prey and we prey

The queens heart (queens heart)
The knights of shame (knights of shame)
So we prey and we prey!

The queens heart
The peoples voice
So we prey and we prey

The queens heart
The knights of shame
So we prey

And yeah it's no fun waiting for the fall
And there'll be no more waiting for you all
And there'll be one more chance for the truth
Without you, I will die
x2

Without you, I will die

Waiting on a heart beat
Is anybody listening?
Waiting on a heart beat
Can anybody hear me?
x2

Ahhhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh

Oooohhhh, ahhhh
