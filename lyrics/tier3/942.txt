Make no mistake I don't do anything for free
I keep my enemies closer than my mirror ever gets to me
And if you think that there is shelter in this attitude
wait till you feel the warmth of my gratitude

One,
I get the feeling that it's two against
One,
I'm already fighting me so what's another one?
The mirror is a trigger and your mouth's a
Gun,
Lucky for me I'm not the only one

And if it looks to me like you and your reflection
plan to add your own fire to this dimension.
then tell it that this is ain't no free for all to see
there's only three... Its just you and me against me

One,
I get the feeling that it's two against
One,
I'm already fighting me so what's another one?
The mirror is a trigger and your mouth's a
Gun,
Lucky for me I'm not the only one
Lucky for me I'm not the only one

And if your foot soldiers, sycophants, and yes men
plan to break into the middle of this little plan
Then they should plan to hear me say,
that I won't play around the way, anyway,
I plan to plan around them

One,
I get the feeling that it's two against
One,
I'm already fighting me so what's another one?
The mirror is a trigger and your mouth's a
Gun,
Lucky for me I'm not the only one
Lucky for me I'm not the only one
