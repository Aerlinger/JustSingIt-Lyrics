Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a player like oh
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy, can I?

Sexy, can I hit it from the front?
Can I hit it from the back? Know you like it like that
Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
Then we chill for a second, then were back at it some more

Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl how you shake it, got a player like oh
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy, can I?

What up lil mama? It's ya boy Yunky
G5 dippin, Louis Vuitton luggage
Ay, gotta love it, ya boy so fly
And all the ladies go oh when a ***** go by

Gucci on the feet, Marc Jacob on the thigh
She wanna ride or die with ya boy in the Chi
That's right, so I let her kiss the prince
Her boyfriend she ain't missed him since

Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl, how you shake it, got a player like oh
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy, can I?

Sexy, can I? Keep it on the low
Got a girl at the crib, we can take it to the mo-mo
You can bring a friend or you can ride solo
Let me get my camera so we can take a photo

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now go shawty, go shawty
Baby when we make love it's like
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't know what your man is like
But shawty all I want to know is, sexy, can I?

Sexy, can I visit you at work?
While you sliding down the pole, no panties, no shirt
Then you climb back up the pole, then you drop and do the splits
How you make that booty talk, baby damn, you want some new sh**?

(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Now go shawty, go shawty
I make it rain in the club like
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I don't know what your man is like
But baby all I want to know is sexy, can I?

Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl, how you shake it, got a player like oh
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy, can I?

I don't care who ya boys hittin or who Ray's mellin
When I give it to her, I know that she ain't tellin'
See I'm a go-getta and she a go get it
You already know, sh**, sexy, can I?

Sexy, can I send for you red-eye?
Fresh out the pool, no towel, let it air dry
And if you ain't ****** tonight
Man, you can watch that tour bus go by

Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl, how you shake it, got a player like oh
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy, can I?

Sexy, can I hit it from the front?
Can I hit it from the back? Know you like it like that
Then we take it to the bed, then we take it to the floor
Then we chill for a second, then we're back at it some more

Sexy, can I? Just pardon my manners
Girl, how you shake it, got a player like whoa
It's a Kodak moment, let me go and get my camera
All I wanna know is, sexy, can I?

I just wanna have some fun
You know I wanna have somethin too
I said, can I just have some fun?
We about to sign a mansion now
And we can do it with the cameras out
Sexy, can I?
