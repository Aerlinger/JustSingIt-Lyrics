(Shawty snaps)
T-Pain
(Damn, shawty snaps)
Yung Joc
(Shawty snaps)
Ey, ey, she snappin

Snap ya fingers, do the step
You can do it all by yourself

Baby girl, whats your name?
Let me talk to you, let me buy you a drank
Im T-Pain, you know me
Konvict Music, Nappy Boy

I know the club close at 3
Whats the chances of you rollin' wit me?
Back to the crib, show you how I live
Lets get drunk, forget what we did

Cause Ima buy you a drank
Ima take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty whachu think bout that?
Find me in the grey Cadillac

We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Talk to me, I talk back
Lets talk money, I talk that
Crunk juice bombs, Oakley shades
Shawty got class, oh behave

Lets get gone, walk it out
(Now walk it out)
Just like that, thats what I'm talkin' 'bout
We gon have fun, you gon see
On that Patron, you should get like me

Ima buy you a drank
Ima take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty whachu think bout that?
Find me in the grey Cadillac

We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Wont you meet me at the bar? Respect big pimpin'
Tell me how you feel, mama tell me what you sippin'
A certified dime piece deserve Louis one three
150 a shot, 3 for you and 3 for me

Im checkin' yo body language, I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips I get a tinglin' sensation
Now we're both 'bout tipsy, you say you in the mood
All I need is 'bout a hour, better yet, maybe two

Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in ya ear ya legs hit the chandelier
Passion, fruit and sex all in the atmosphere
Ima let T-Pain sing it so he can make it clear

Ima buy you a drank
Ima take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty whachu think bout that?
Find me in the grey Cadillac

We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Lets get gone, walk it out
(Now walk it out, think about it, aw snap!)
Now rock rock rock rock
You can do it all by yo'self

Lets get gone, walk it out
(Now walk it out, think about it, aw snap!)
Now rock rock rock rock
You can do it all by yo'self

Ima buy you a drank
Ima take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty whachu think bout that?
Find me in the grey Cadillac

We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
