Take what you need and leave the rest,
No I don't mind, no I don't mind,
I'll get this off my chest,
There's no where else I'd rather be
Come flying in, and then again,
I'm not here long enough to pretend that I seem so well ,
There's no where else you'd rather be
Like a hummingbird in flight you are
Hovering, hovering round' me
When I move near, you fly away
Like a hummingbird in flight you are
Hovering, hovering near me, as I
Move near you fly away,
don't fly away, don't fly away, don't fly away
What can I say? You have to wait,
I find it hard to say and to articulate
I know there's nowhere else you'd rather be
It seems so clear,
I know we're through,
Yet all I wanna do is make love to you
I know there's no where else you'd rather be
Like a hummingbird in flight you are
Hovering, hovering near me
As I move near you fly away
Like a hummingbird in flight you are
Hovering, hovering near me
As I move near you fly away,
don't fly away 5x
Buzzing around my head, things you have done,
The words you have said,
Remain with me after you've left,
I try but I can't forget
Like a hummingbird in flight you are
Hovering, hovering around me
As I move near you fly away.
Like a hummingbird in flight you are
Hovering, hovering around me
As I move near you fly away.
don't fly away 5x
