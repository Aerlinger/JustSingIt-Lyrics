Honey suckle in the air, breese blowing through your hair
Hundred stars hanging high, under your still tide
Up in every move you make, baby I'm your DJ
You're my favorite song, won't you let me sing-a-long

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down, I'm turning it up and you're
Spinnin' around, takin' a sip, swingin' your hips, girl you're looking so
Fine, with your beer in the headlights

Heart beating like a drum, call me the lucky one
Shining these Hi-Beams on you baby, boots stiring up the dirt
Cottonfield concert, you got the beautiful, I got the cooler full

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
I got the key turned back, windows down, I'm turning it up and you're
Spinnin' around, takin' a sip, swingin' your hips, girl you're looking so
Fine, with your beer in the headlights

With your beer in the headlights,

Sittin' right here, out here in the middle of nowhere, nowhere
I swear I've never seen, ever seen nothing like you anywhere
Ohhh ohh ohhh
I got the key turned back, windows down, I'm turning it up and you're
Spinnin' around, takin' a sip, swingin' your hips,
Girl you're looking so fine, with your beer in the headlights

With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
With your beer in the headlights
