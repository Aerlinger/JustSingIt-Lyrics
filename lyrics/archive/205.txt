	<li><p>Sometimes we fall down, can't get back up</p></li>
	<li><p>We're hiding behind skin that's too tough</p></li>
	<li><p>How come we don't say I love you enough</p></li>
	<li><p>Till it's to late, it's not too late</p></li>
	<li><p>Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come</p></li>
	<li><p>And we could make a feast from these crumbs</p></li>
	<li><p>And we're all staring down the barrel of a gun</p></li>
	<li><p>So if your life flashed before you,</p></li>
	<li><p>What would you wish you would've done</p></li>
	<li><p>Yeah, we gotta start</p></li>
	<li><p>Looking at the hands of the time we've been given</p></li>
	<li><p>If this is all we got and we gotta start thinking</p></li>
	<li><p>If every second counts on a clock that's ticking</p></li>
	<li><p>Gotta live like we're dying</p></li>
	<li><p>We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to</p></li>
	<li><p>Turn it all around or to throw it all away</p></li>
	<li><p>We gotta tell them that we love them</p></li>
	<li><p>While we got the chance to say</p></li>
	<li><p>Gotta live like we're dying</p></li>
	<li><p>And if your plane fell out of the skies</p></li>
	<li><p>Who would you call with your last goodbye</p></li>
	<li><p>Should be so careful who we live out our lives</p></li>
	<li><p>So when we long for absolution,</p></li>
	<li><p>There'll no one on the line, yeah</p></li>
	<li><p>Yeah, we gotta start</p></li>
	<li><p>Looking at the hands of the time we've been given</p></li>
	<li><p>If this is all we got and we gotta start thinking</p></li>

	<li><p>Gotta live like we're dying</p></li>
	<li><p>Like we're dying, oh, like we're dying</p></li>

	<li><p>You never know a good thing till it's gone</p></li>
	<li><p>You never see a crash till it's head on</p></li>
	<li><p>Why do we think we're right when we're dead wrong</p></li>
	<li><p>You never know a good thing till it's gone</p></li>
	<li><p>Yeah, we gotta start</p></li>
