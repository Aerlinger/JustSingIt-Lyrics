Sosa baby, you know I'm rockin baby
GBE baby, O'block

[Hook:]

And what we smoke one hunna
But nigga I'm three hunna
Click Clack, Pow, now he runnin
Don't be fuckin with my youngins

[Verse 1:]
A fuck nigga don't wanna be it

My gun don't make me beat it

A lot of kush, a lot of guns nigga
You see you us you better run nigga

Fuck a tooka gang bitch I'm 3hunna

Big gun that knock ya head off
