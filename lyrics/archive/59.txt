	<li><p>Have you got colour in your cheeks?</p></li>
	<li><p>Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the tide</p></li>
	<li><p>that sticks around like summat in your teeth?</p></li>
	<li><p>Are there some aces up your sleeve?</p></li>
	<li><p>Have you no idea that you're in deep?</p></li>
	<li><p>I dreamt about you nearly every night this week</p></li>
	<li><p>How many secrets can you keep?</p></li>
	<li><p>'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think</p></li>
	<li><p>of you somehow and I play it on repeat</p></li>
	<li><p>Until I fall asleep</p></li>
	<li><p>Spilling drinks on my settee</p></li>
	<li><p>(Do I wanna know?)</p></li>
	<li><p>If this feeling flows both ways</p></li>
	<li><p>(Sad to see you go)</p></li>
	<li><p>Was sort of hoping that you'd stay</p></li>
	<li><p>(Baby we both know)</p></li>
	<li><p>That the nights were mainly made for saying things</p></li>
	<li><p>that you can't say tomorrow day</p></li>
	<li><p>Crawlin' back to you</p></li>
	<li><p>Ever thought of calling when you've had a few</p></li>
	<li><p>'Cause I always do</p></li>
	<li><p>Maybe I'm too busy being yours</p></li>
	<li><p>to fall for somebody new</p></li>
	<li><p>Now I've thought it through</p></li>
	<li><p>Crawlin' back to you</p></li>
	<li><p>So have you got the guts?</p></li>
	<li><p>Been wondering if your heart's still open</p></li>
	<li><p>and if so I wanna know what time it shuts</p></li>
	<li><p>Simmer down and pucker up</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm sorry to interrupt</p></li>
	<li><p>it's just I'm constantly on the cusp</p></li>
	<li><p>of trying to kiss you</p></li>
	<li><p>I don't know if you feel the same as I do</p></li>
	<li><p>But we could be together if you wanted to</p></li>
	<li><p>(Do I wanna know?)</p></li>
	<li><p>If this feeling flows both ways</p></li>
	<li><p>(Sad to see you go)</p></li>
	<li><p>Was sort of hoping that you'd stay</p></li>
	<li><p>(Baby we both know)</p></li>
	<li><p>That the nights were mainly made for saying things</p></li>
	<li><p>that you can't say tomorrow day</p></li>
	<li><p>Crawlin' back to you (crawlin' back to you)</p></li>
	<li><p>Ever thought of calling when you've had a few? (you've had a few)</p></li>
	<li><p>'Cause I always do ('cause I always do)</p></li>
	<li><p>Maybe I'm too (maybe I'm too busy) busy being yours</p></li>
	<li><p>to fall for somebody new</p></li>
	<li><p>Now I've thought it through</p></li>
	<li><p>Crawlin' back to you</p></li>
