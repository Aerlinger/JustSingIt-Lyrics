Let's go

I wanna go to Ibiza, let's go
I wanna go to Argentina, let's go
Yeah, I wanna go and dance, d-d-dance
I wanna dance in Paris, France, let's go

I wanna go around the world, let's go
And party with the girls, let's go
And when I get there, when I get there
When I'm there I wanna go

I wanna go crazy, I wanna go
I wanna go crazy, I wanna go
I wanna go crazy, I wanna go

I wanna go crazy, that's where I wanna go
I wanna go crazy, yeah, I wanna go there
I wanna go crazy, with you, girl, let's go

I need a go, need a fuckin' go
Go and celebrate life with a suicide, girl
I wanna go, go, now go
I'mma celebrate life with a suicide, girl

I need to go, need a fuckin' go
Go celebrate life with a suicide girl
I need g-g-go now go
Yeah, I'ma a celebrate with a suicide, girl

I wanna go crazy, crazy in the US of A
I wanna go crazy, crazy in the USSR
I wanna go crazy, Moscow, here I come

I wanna go crazy, I wanna go
And when I get there, when I get there
When I'm there I wanna go

I wanna go, I wanna go
I wanna go crazy

Where I wanna go ain't geographical
You can't Google map, map quest it when I go loco
If you need to know the designation, I'm going crazy
I ain't by myself I'm coming with a whole bunch of ladies

Celebrating life to the max, girls are suicidal
In the club sippin' bottle after bottle after bottle
Celebration never stoppin', situation club hoppin'
Simulation panty droppin', penetration coochie poppin'
Then I'm out

I need to go back to Mars
We about to take off

In ten, nine, eight, seven
Six, five, four, three, two, one

I wanna go crazy, I wanna go I wanna go
I wanna go crazy, that's where I wanna go
I wanna go crazy, that's where I wanna go

I wanna go crazy, with you, girl, with you
I wanna go crazy, with you, girl, with you
I wanna go crazy, that where I wanna go

I wanna go crazy
