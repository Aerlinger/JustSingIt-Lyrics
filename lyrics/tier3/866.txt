Wrapped in a blanket of hope
Asleep in the bed of dreams
My step into eternity was not what it might have been
Or not at all
For who knows which way the wind is gonna blow
Im waiting for your gentle whisper

Distant child, my flower
Are you blowing in the breeze?
Can you feel me?
As I breathe life into you
In a while my flower
Somewhere in a desert haze
I know one day youll amaze me

An act of balancing, imagining the moment I can be
Looking deep into your eyes
For now a mystery
Or not at all
For who knows which way the wind is gonna blow
Im waiting for your gentle whisper

Distant child, my flower
Are you blowing in the breeze?
Can you feel me?
As I breathe life into you
In a while my flower
Somewhere in a desert haze
I know one day youll amaze me

2 hearts in the hands of time
Your love bleeds into mine
Ill be with you forever
And give you everything I am
Want you to understand
Its you and I together

Distant child, my flower
Are you blowing in the breeze?
Can you feel me?
As I breathe life into you
In a while my flower
Somewhere in a desert haze
I know one day youll amaze me
