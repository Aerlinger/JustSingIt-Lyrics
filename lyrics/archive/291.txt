	<li><p>I remember, tryin not to stare the night</p></li>
	<li><p>That I first met you</p></li>
	<li><p>You had me mesmerized</p></li>
	<li><p>And three weeks weeks later in the front porch light</p></li>
	<li><p>Taking 45 minutes just to kiss goodnight</p></li>
	<li><p>I hadn't told you</p></li>
	<li><p>That I loved you then</p></li>
	<li><p>And now you're my whole life</p></li>
	<li><p>And now you're my whole world</p></li>
	<li><p>And I just can't believe</p></li>
	<li><p>The way I feel about you girl</p></li>
	<li><p>Like a river needs the sea</p></li>
	<li><p>Stronger than its ever been</p></li>
	<li><p>We've come so far since that day</p></li>
	<li><p>And I thought I loved you then</p></li>
	<li><p>I remember takin' you back to right</p></li>
	<li><p>Where I first met you</p></li>
	<li><p>You were so surprised</p></li>
	<li><p>There were people around, but I didn't care</p></li>
	<li><p>I got down on one knee right there</p></li>
	<li><p>And once again</p></li>
	<li><p>I thought I loved you then</p></li>
	<li><p>And now you're my whole life</p></li>
	<li><p>And now you're my whole world</p></li>
	<li><p>And I just cant believe</p></li>
	<li><p>The way I feel about you girl</p></li>
	<li><p>Like a river needs the sea</p></li>
	<li><p>Stronger than its ever been</p></li>
	<li><p>We've come so far since that day</p></li>
	<li><p>And I thought I loved you then</p></li>
	<li><p>I can just see you</p></li>
	<li><p>With a baby on the way</p></li>
	<li><p>I can just see you</p></li>
	<li><p>When your hair is turning gray</p></li>
	<li><p>What I cant see is how I'm ever gonna love you more</p></li>
	<li><p>But I've said that before</p></li>
	<li><p>Now you're my whole life</p></li>
	<li><p>Now you're my whole world</p></li>
	<li><p>I just cant believe the way I feel about you girl</p></li>
	<li><p>We'll look back someday at this moment we're in</p></li>
	<li><p>And I'll look at you and say</p></li>
	<li><p>And I thought I loved you then</p></li>
	<li><p>And I thought I loved you then</p></li>
