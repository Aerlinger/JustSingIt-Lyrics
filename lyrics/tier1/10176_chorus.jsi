[:chorus:]
Life is one big party when you're still young
But who's gonna have your back when it's all done
It's all good when you're little, you have pure fun
Can't be a fool, son, what about the long run?
Looking back shorty always mention
Said me not giving her much attention
She was there through my incarceration
I wanna show the nation my appreciation
Girl, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps you are to me, baby
Shorty, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl, you're my friend when i'm in need, lady

You're a queen and so you should be treated
Though you never get the lovin' that you needed
Could have left, but i called and you heeded
Takin' a beatin', mission completed
Mama said that i and i dissed the program
Not the type to mess around with your emotion
But the feeling that i have for you is so strong
Been together so long and this could never be wrong
Girl, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps you are to me, baby
Shorty, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl, you're my friend when i'm in need, lady
Girl, in spite of my behavior, said i'm your savior
(you must be sent from up above)
And you appear to me so tender, say girl i surrender
(thanks for giving me your love)
Girl, in spite of my behavior, well, you are my savior
(you must be sent from up above)
And you appear to me so tender, well, girl i surrender
(said thanks for giving me your love)

[:chorus:]
Now life is one big party when you're still young
And who's gonna have your back when it's all done
It's all good when you're little, you have pure fun
Can't be a fool, son, what about the long run?
Looking back shorty always mention
Said me not giving her much attention
She was there through my incarceration
I wanna show the nation, my appreciation
Girl, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Closer than my peeps you are to me, baby
Shorty, you're my angel, you're my darling angel
Girl, you're my friend when i'm in need, lady
