Here ya go honey yeah here's some Patron
You better sip it slow, it's bad to the bone
Don't want you gettin' too far gone
And I have to tote ya out of here roll you on home
Keep on shaking that money maker
They're just jealous just bunch of haters
The rest of this night's gonna be what we make it
There's some wild in that smile baby what you say we take it

Off the beaten path
One foot on the dash and one on the floorboard
Off the beaten path
Country rock crankin' through speakers in the four door
Silverado baby do you wanna go
Out where the good love grows
Off the beaten path, yeah

I could sit right here and watch you dance all night
'Til the sun comes up 'til they turn out the lights
That drunk son of a buck's 'bout to have him a fight
If he don't watch his step he'll get a left then a right
What you mean you never sat in a jacked up truck
Well I'll be damned girl you're in luck
There's a little spot out there I'd like to show ya
By the light of the radio I'd like to get to get to know ya

Off the beaten path
One foot on the dash and one on the floorboard
Off the beaten path
Country rock crankin' through speakers in the four door
Silverado baby do you wanna go
Out where the good love grows
Off the beaten path, yeah

Like a deep groove country song baby
I wanna turn you on, yeah

Off the beaten path
One foot on the dash and one on the floorboard
Off the beaten path
Country rock crankin' through speakers in the four door
Silverado baby do you wanna go
Out where the good love grows
Off the beaten path, yeah

Off the beaten path

Baby let me take ya
Baby let me take ya

Baby let me take ya
Off the beaten path
