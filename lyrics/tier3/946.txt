Confidence and ignorance approve me
Define my day today
I've tried so hard to shut it down
Lock it up, gently walk away

Appetites and impulses confuse me
Decide my day-to-day
Now my body says it's over
Shakin' hands move to tear my face away

And when the night comes, I'm fiending like a pyro
And I know it stables my survival
When there's music all 'round me
And I haven't got a single word to say

And then the light shines, it's gleaming like a bottle
And Lord knows I tackled it full throttle
May I illuminate the nameless, faceless saints
Of these hard and open graves

Every lover on a mission
Shift your known position, livin' a lie
Every diamond down the middle
You are instrumental to the light

Every silent evolution
Make your contribution to the light
Every lover on a mission
Shift your known position to the light

Old body, mind, leaves me behind
And I'll do you one better
While you define your heartless time
I'll defend my love forever

Every lover on a mission
Shift your known position, livin' a lie
Every diamond down the middle
You are instrumental to the light

Every silent evolution
Make your contribution to the light
Every glorious disaster
Everyone is gonna bring this faster out into the light, the light
