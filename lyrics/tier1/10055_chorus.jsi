[:chorus:]
All i ever wanted, all i ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm

Vows are spoken to be broken
Feelings are intense, words are trivial
Pleasures remain, so does their pain
Words are meaningless and forgettable

[:chorus:]
All i ever wanted, all i ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
