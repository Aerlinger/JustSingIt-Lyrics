25 Take me off the sidelines25 Blow sand beneath my feet* 43 Break me out this gilded cage that holds me0 32 Come fill my veins with sunlight29 Send a postcard from my lungs36 I wanna taste salvation on my tongue0 18 The goal - control31 And I won’t waste a second more34 Can you hear what I’m thinking of?0 39 You gotta hold on tight, we’re going up32 And I know I want it hard enough0 19 Raging like a rebel28 There’s a riot in my streets40 Come feel the revolution in my heartbeat0 27 Now push me down the runway21 And serenade my climb* 49 It’s time to leave this star-crossed world behind0 17 The goal: control31 And I won’t waste a second more34 Can you feel what I’m thinking of?0 39 You gotta hold on tight, we’re going up32 And I know I want it hard enough0 29 And Mary when you see me rise27 Fading in a distant skyline25 Know I’ll be back for you
