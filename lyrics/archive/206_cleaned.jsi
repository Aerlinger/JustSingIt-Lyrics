Tougher than a lion
Aint no need in tryin'
I live where the sky ends
Yup, you kno' this
Never lyin', true tella
That Rihanna rain just won't let up
All black on, black top shades
Black top Mayyybach
I'ma rock this s*** like fashion hasn't

And my, runway never looked so clear
With the hottest b**** heels right here
No fear, and while you are getting your cry on

Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top (top, top)

Run through yo town

Brilliant, resilient
Fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all

Go hard or go home
Back to your residence
Soon the red doors get a block back to the presidents
I used to run my old block like Obama did
You don't gotta believe me, go ask my momma then
Couldn't even come in my room
Smell like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playin' casino
Cali's all I keep in my bag in California
Tell them to give me back my swag
They try to clone me
You see my Louis chucks, Louis bag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me
Louis mane
I'm in the all white party wearin' all black
With my new black watch called the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, cardiac wrist
Yeah, they say they're hard
They aint hard as this
Hard
One word describes me
And if I wasn't doin' this
You know where I be, too hard
Where them girls talkin' trash
Where them girls talkin' trash
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where them bloggers girls at
Where them bloggers girls at
Where they at, where they at, where they at
Where ya lighters at
