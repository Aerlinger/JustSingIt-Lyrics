Stupid girl
Stupid girls
Stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Want a paparazzi girl?
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Go to Fred Segal you'll find them there
Laughin' loud so all the little people stare
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne
Drop a name

What happened to the dream of a girl president?
She's dancin' in the video next to 50 Cent
They travel in packs of 2 or 3
With their itsy bitsy doggies and their teenie weenie tees

Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?
Oh where, oh where could they be?

Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Want a paparazzi girl?
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

The disease is growing, it's epidemic
I'm scared that there ain't a cure
The world believes it and I'm going crazy
I cannot take anymore

I'm so glad that I'll never fit in
That will never be me
Outcasts and girls with ambition
That's what I wanna see

Disasters all around
(Disasters all around)
A world of despair
(A world of despair)
Their only concern
Will it eat up my hair?

Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Want a paparazzi girl?
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Do your thing, an' do your thing
Do your thing, an' do your thing
Do your thing, I like this
Like this, like this

Pretty will you eat me girl
Silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair, I'll eat it girl
Stupid girl!

Pretty will you eat me girl
Silly I'm so lucky girl
Pull my hair, I'll eat you up
Stupid girl!

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that
Stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
That guy will call me back
Want a paparazzi girl?
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that
I don't wanna be a stupid girl

Maybe if I act like that
Flippin' my blonde hair back
Push up my bra like that
Stupid girls
Stupid girls
Stupid girls
