Lala lala la lala
Hah aaa aaa
Aah aaa aaa okay

Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Come back and bring back my smile
Come and take these tears away
I need your arms to hold me now
The nights are so unkind
Bring back those nights when I held you beside me

Unbreak my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Uncry these tears
I cried so many nights
Unbreak my heart
My heart

Take back that sad word goodbye
Bring back the joy to my life
Don't leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel without you here beside me

Unbreak my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Uncry these tears
I cried so many nights
Unbreak my heart
My heart
Heart
Umm

Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back the nights when I held you beside me

Oh
Unbreak my heart
Say you'll love me again
Undo this hurt you caused
When you walked out the door
And walked outta my life
Uncry these tears
I cried so many, many nights
Oh unbreak my

Unbreak my heart, oh baby
Come back and say you love me
Unbreak my heart
Sweet darlin'
Without you I just can't go on

Say that you love
Say that you love
Tell me you love
Unbreak my heart
(Can't go on)
(Woh)
Say that you love
Say that you love
Tell me you love
Unbreak my
Say that you love
Say that you love
Tell me you love
Unbreak my
Say that you love
Say that you love
Tell me
