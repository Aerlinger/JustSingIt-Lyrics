So far away

This time, this place
Misused, mistakes
Too long, too late
Who was I to make you wait?

Just one chance, just one breath
Just in case theres just one left
Cause you know
You know, you know

That I love you, I have loved you all along
And I miss you, been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming youll be with me and youll never go
Stop breathing if I dont see you anymore

On my knees, Ill ask
Last chance for one last dance
Cause with you Id withstand
All of it to hold your hand

Id give it all, Id give for us
Give anything but I wont give up
Cause you know
You know, you know

That I love you, I have loved you all along
And I miss you, been far away for far too long
I keep dreaming youll be with me and youll never go
Stop breathing if I dont see you anymore

So far away, been far away for far too long
So far away, been far away for far too long
But you know
You know, you know

I wanted
I wanted you to stay
Cause I needed
I need to hear you say

I love you, I have loved you all along
And I forgive you for being away for far too long
So keep breathing cause Im not leaving you anymore
Believe it, hold on to me, never let me go

Keep breathing cause Im not leaving you anymore
Believe it, hold on to me, never let me go
Hold on to me, never let me go
Hold on to me, never let me go
