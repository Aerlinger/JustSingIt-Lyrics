(Climbing out back the door, didn't leave a mark)
(No one knows it's you Miss Jackson)
(Found another victim)
(But no one's ever gonna find Miss Jackson) (Jackson)

You put a sour little flavor in my mouth now
You move in circles hoping no one's gonna find out
But we're so lucky,
Kiss the ring and let 'em bow down
Looking for the time of your life (No one's gonna find out)

A pretty picture but the scenery is so loud,
A face like heaven catching lighting in your nightgown,
But back away from the water, babe, you might drowned
The party isn't over tonight (Party in your night gown)

Hey
Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey
Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway (Hey)
I love her anyway (Hey)
I love her anyway (Hey)
Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway

Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson
Are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson
Are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson
Are you nasty? Are you nasty?
I love her anyway

Oh,
Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh
Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway

Way down 'til the fire finally dies out
You've got 'em wrapped around your finger watch 'em fall down
There's something beautiful and tragic in the fall out
Let me say it one more time (Tragic in the fall out)

Hey
Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Hey
Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway (Hey, hey , hey)
I love her anyway (Hey)
I love her anyway (Hey)
Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway

Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson
Are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson
Are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson
Are you nasty? Are you nasty?
I love her anyway

Oh
Where will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh
Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway

(Climbing out back the door, didn't leave a mark)
(No one knows it's you Miss Jackson)
(Found another victim)
(But no one's ever gonna find Miss Jackson) (Jackson)

(Sing the next um, hit record) I love her anyway
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson
Are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson
Are you nasty?
Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson, Miss Jackson
Are you nasty? Are you nasty?
I love her anyway

Oh
When will you be waking up tomorrow morning?
Oh
Out the back door goddamn but I love her anyway
