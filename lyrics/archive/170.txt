	<li><p>I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence</p></li>
	<li><p>Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearing the consequence</p></li>
	<li><p>Drinking every night because we drink to my accomplishments</p></li>
	<li><p>Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness</p></li>
	<li><p>And they saying I'm back, I agree with that</p></li>
	<li><p>I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that</p></li>
	<li><p>I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that</p></li>
	<li><p>And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?</p></li>
	<li><p>I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that</p></li>
	<li><p>Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause I'm just mobbin' like that</p></li>
	<li><p>You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that</p></li>
	<li><p>You gonna make someone around me catch a body like that</p></li>
	<li><p>No, don't do it, please don't do it</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it</p></li>
	<li><p>And drizzy got the money, so drizzy gonna pay it</p></li>
	<li><p>Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it</p></li>
	<li><p>That's just something they know</p></li>
	<li><p>They know, they know, they know</p></li>
	<li><p>That the real is on the rise, fuck them other guys</p></li>
	<li><p>I even gave 'em a chance to decide, now it's something they know</p></li>
	<li><p>They know, they know, they know</p></li>
	<li><p>I be yelling out money over everything, money on my mind</p></li>
	<li><p>Then she wanna ask when it got so empty</p></li>
	<li><p>Tell her I apologize, happened over time</p></li>
	<li><p>She says they miss the old drake, girl don't tempt me</p></li>
	<li><p>If they don't get it, they'll be over you</p></li>
	<li><p>That new shit that you got is overdue</p></li>
	<li><p>You better do what you supposed to do</p></li>
	<li><p>I'm like "Why I gotta be all that?" but still I can't deny the fact</p></li>
	<li><p>That it's true, listening to you expressing all them feelings</p></li>
	<li><p>Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like "All my children"</p></li>
	<li><p>And that's who you thinking is 'bout to come and make a killing</p></li>
	<li><p>I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions</p></li>
	<li><p>You know that they ain't even got it like that</p></li>
	<li><p>You gonna hype me up and make me catch a body like that</p></li>
	<li><p>Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that</p></li>
	<li><p>When they get my shit and play it, I ain't even gotta say it, they know</p></li>
	<li><p>They know, they know, they know</p></li>
	<li><p>That the real is on the rise, fuck them other guys</p></li>
	<li><p>I even gave 'em a chance to decide, now it's something they know</p></li>
	<li><p>They know, they know, they know</p></li>
	<li><p>I be yelling out: money over everything, money on my mind</p></li>
	<li><p>Tell them I apologize, it happened over time, they know</p></li>
	<li><p>I heard once that they would rather hear about memories than enemies</p></li>
	<li><p>Rather hear what was or will be than what is</p></li>
	<li><p>Rather hear how you got it over how much it cost you</p></li>
	<li><p>Rather hear about finding yourself and how you lost you</p></li>
	<li><p>Rather you make this an open letter, about family and struggle and it taking forever</p></li>
	<li><p>About hearts that you’ve broken and ties that you’ve severed</p></li>
	<li><p>No doubt in my mind, that’ll make them feel better</p></li>
