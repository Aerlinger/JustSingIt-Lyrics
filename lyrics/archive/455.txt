Life's like a road that you travel on
There's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind

There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore where the brave are free and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won't hesitate
To break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today, yeah

Life is a highway, I wanna ride it
All night long
If you're going my way, I wanna drive it
All night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
Knock me down and back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
The road's so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway, I wanna ride it
All night long
If your going my way, I wanna drive it
All night long

Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, yeah

Life is a highway, I wanna ride it
All night long (mmmm yeah)
If your going my way, I wanna drive it
All night long

There was a distance between you and I
(between you and I)
A misunderstanding once
But now, we look it in the eye

Ooooo...Yeah.

There ain't no load I can't hold
The road's so rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in tell 'em we're survivors

Life is a highway, I wanna ride it
All night long (all night long, yeah hey)
If your going my way, I wanna drive it
All night long

Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme some more

Life is a highway, I wanna ride it
All night long
If your going my way, I wanna drive it
All night long

Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme some more

Life is a highway, I wanna ride it
All night long
If your going my way, I wanna drive it
All night long

Gimme, Gimme, Gimme, Gimme some more, yeah
