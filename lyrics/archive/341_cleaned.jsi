Oh yeah
Oh yeah

I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene or sneak away to the Philippines
They still gon' put pictures of my derrire in the magazine
You want a piece of me? You want a piece of me?

I'm Miss Bad Media Karma, another day, another drama
Guess I can't see the harm in workin' and being a mama
And with a kid on my arm, I'm still an exceptional earner
You want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles Of The Rich & Famous
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God, That Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me?)

I'm Mrs. Extra, Extra, This Just In
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin
(You want a piece of me?)

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

I'm Mrs. You Wanna Piece Of Me?
Tryin' and @#$%' me off
Well get in line with the paparazzi
Who's flippin' me off?

Hoping I'll resort to some havoc
End up settlin' in court
Now are you sure you want a piece of me?
(You want a piece of me?)

I'm Mrs. Most Likely To Get On The TV For Strippin' On The Streets
When gettin' the groceries, no, for real are you kiddin' me?
No wonder there's panic in the industry
I mean, please, do you want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles Of The Rich & Famous
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God, That Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me?)

I'm Mrs. Extra, Extra, This Just In
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin
(You want a piece of me?)

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

I'm Miss American Dream since I was 17
Don't matter if I step on the scene or sneak away to the Philippines
They still gon' put pictures of my derrire in the magazine
You want a piece of me? You want a piece, piece of me?
You want a piece of me?

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles Of The Rich & Famous
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God, That Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me?)

I'm Mrs. Extra, Extra, This Just In
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin
(You want a piece of me?)

I'm Mrs. Lifestyles Of The Rich & Famous
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. Oh My God, That Britney's Shameless
(You want a piece of me?)

I'm Mrs. Extra, Extra, This Just In
(You want a piece of me?)
I'm Mrs. She's Too Big, Now She's Too Thin
(You want a piece of me?)

Oh yeah
You want a piece of me?
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
