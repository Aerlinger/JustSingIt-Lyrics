Flashing lights
Flashing lights
Flashing lights
Flashing lights

She don't believe in shootin' stars
But she believe in shoes and cars
Wood floors in the new apartment
Couture from the store's departments

You more like love to start shit
I'm more of the trips to Florida
Ordered the hors doeuvres, views of the water
Straight from a page of your favorite author

And the weather's so breezy
Man, why can't life always be this easy?
She in the mirror dancin' so sleazy
I get a call like, "Where are you, Yeezy?"

And try to hit you with the ol' wopty
Till I got flashed by the paparazzi
Damn, these niggas got me
I hate these niggas more than a Nazzi

As I recall I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know
(Flashing lights)
What do I know
(Flashing lights)
Know

I know it's been a while, sweetheart
We hardly talk, I was doin' my thing
I know it was bad, baby
Hey babe, lately you been all on my brain

And if somebody woulda told me a month ago
Frontin' on, yo, I wouldn't want to know
If somebody woulda told me a year ago
It'd go get this difficult

Feelin like Katrina with no FEMA
Like Martin with no Gina
Like a flight with no visa
First class with the seat back, I still see ya

In my past, you on the other side of the glass
Of my memory's museum
I'm just sayin', hey Mona Lisa, come home
You know you can't Rome without Caesar

As I recall I know you love to show off
But I never thought that you would take it this far
But what do I know
(Flashing lights)
What do I know
(Flashing lights)
Know

As you recall you know I love to show off
But you never thought that I would take it this far
But what do you know
(Flashing lights)
What do you know
(Flashing lights)
Know

Flashing lights
Flashing lights
